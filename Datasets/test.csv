WELL, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SCAM LETTERS FROM (GHANA OR OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BUT FROM A FAMILY OF WHO ARE IN DISTRESS AND REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.LET ME START BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU.

NGOLA BEFORE HIS DEATH DIVERTED THIS FUND (US$25M) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. MEANT FOR PURCHASE OF AMMUNATION FOR MY COUNTRY ""LIBERIA"" DURING THE PERIOD OF THEETHNIC CIVIL WAR BETWEEN MY COUNTRY AND GUINEA REPUBLIC. AND NOW, THE WAR IS OVER BY THE INTERVENTION OF ""ECOMOG""FORCES. 


FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE WAR ENDED, THE RADIO NATIONAL OF LIBERIA WENT ON AIR, ON A WILD BROADCAST, UNCINGAN UNSUCCESSFUL ""COUPD'TAT"" IN MY COUNTRY, ATTEPTED TO OVERTROW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN MY COUNTRY HEADED BY ""PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR"". THIS BROADCAST CONTINUED TO ANNOUNCE THE NAMES OF THOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT. BUT UNKNOWINGLY TO ME, MY FATHER WAS INCLUDED AMOUNG THESE GROUP OF MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLOT AS THE ""MASTERMINDER"" AND THE ""FINANCIER"" OF THIS UNDEMOCRATIC ACT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG SIDE WITH OTHERS. (MAY THEIR SOULS REST IN PERFECT PEACE)

TWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR EXECUTION THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA STIL WENT FURTHER TO PASS JURGEMENT TO CONFISTICATE MY FATHER'S ASSETS AND ALSO TO FREEZE HIS ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED ME, I HURRIEDLY GATHERED SOME VALUABLES IN OUR FAMILY VILLA   AND ESCAPED TO (ACCRA), CAPITAL OF GHANA FOR SAFETY, WHILE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS, SISTERS ARE NOW IN COTE D'IVOIRE AS REFUGEES. THIS FILE, WHICH CONTAINING DOCUMENTS OF A CONSIGNMENT (1 METALIC TRUNK BOX) DEPOSITED BY MY LATE FATHER IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES, WAS AMOUNG THE VALUBLE THINGS I ESCAPED WITH TO GHANA. HONESTLY SPEAKING, IN THIS""BOX"" IS THE SUM OF THIS FUND (US$25 M.) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY
DIVERTED BY MY LATE FATHER. HE REGISTERED THIS CONSIGNMENT (BOX) WITH SECURITY COMPANY AS TO CONTAIN (AFRICA ARTS WORK), BUT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY THAT SAYS ONLY HIS FOREIGN PARTNER WILL BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT THE CONSIGNMENT ON HIS BEHALF HENCE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE TRACED WITH THE AMOUNT AS A POPULAR PERSON.




IT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU TO FAITHFULLY AND CONFIDENTIALY ASSIST ME TO ""FRONT"" AS MY LATE FATHER FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER IN ORDER TO NECCESITATE AND FACILITATE THE CLAIM OF THIS CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. AND THE FUND ALSO BE TRANSFERED

ONCE AGAIN, I AM PRESENTLY LIVING IN GHANA ALSO AS A REFUGEE TOO (ASYLUM SEEKER) FOR THE SAKE OF MY LIFE. BE INFORMED, THAT THE FINANCIAL LAW OF GHANA DOES NOT ALLOW A REFUGEE TO OPERATE AN ACCOUNT NOR INCORPORATE A COMPANY. WITH THIS, COUPLED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE MONEY WAS ACQUIRED, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY I DECIDED NOT TO INVEST IN ANYWHERE IN AFRICA OR LIBERIA NOR EVEN GHANA WHERE I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE AND THAT IS WHY I'M SOLICITING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.




IF YOU AGREE TO ASSIST US, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL FUND AFTER THIS CONSIGNMENT IS CLEARED AND THE MONEY TRANSFERED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

0,U R THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IVE EVER SEEN. U R MY BABY COME AND C ME IN THE COMMON ROOM
1,"Greetings from Dubai,
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Majid Al-Hussein, currently Chief Security Officer with a reputable security and finance company here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 
On November 10, 1999, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, Mr. Ahmed Haruna made a deposit of a trunk box in my company depository vault as family valuables, unknowingly that the content of the trunk box were funds valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in our company. This was my recent discovery that prompted me to take this very step of looking for someone to claim the funds with before it will get confiscated.
.
Upon maturity in 2003,as the Chief security officer, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Ahmed Haruna died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Ahmed Harunas family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Deposit paperwork in my Company and did not leave any WILL. This deposited trunk have been lying in our vault since the date of deposit, and the management have decided to term it abandoned deposit and this will result confiscating it by our government since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.
I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my company management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information. 
 
As the Chief security Officer in my Company, I have the power to influence the release of the deposit to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details.


Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Ahmed Haruna when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response.

Mr.Majid Al-Husain

TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
E-MAIL:obilolo@netscape.net 
E-MAIL:bello_dd@doctor.com 

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry Foreign 
Trade Divisionas a reputable organ that can assist us on 
this transaction.

 Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply 
to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or
(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the 
basic procedures for the release of the fund. 

 It does not matter whether you or your company does 
contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated 
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts 
same to more specialized 
firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit 
this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire 
funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been 
set aside to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, 
both local and international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because 

I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.

If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction 
could be accomplished within the shortest possible time 
based on your interest and determination,since the money is 
already on transit.

 Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of this e-
mail on my confidential TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
 The lines may be busy,but keep trying till you get 
through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR,IDRIS BELLO..

On that faithful afternoon, I didn´t know that my father was going to leave me after I had earlier lost my mother, but before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die.

Dear  friend,                                                     

With due respect and humility I send you this mail. Please I 
am indeed sorry bothering you. Permit me a brief intoduction .
I believe that on the basis of such introduction you would 
understand the purpose of this mail.

I am a professional financial advisor on offshore and real
estate investment, portfolio management with a private finance
and security company in Thailand. My company work for expatriate
community here in Bangkok, Thailand. One of my client , Mr. Lee 
Kok Wai, a Singaporean business man deposited the sum of Sixteen
Million, Eight Hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$16.8M)

But sadly and unfortunately, Mr. Lee Kok Wai lost his life in the

1," Dear Sir/Madam. 

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I got your name and contact from the Benin Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to its esteeming nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable and trust-worthy person that I can do business with as per the recommendations. I must not hesitate to confine in you for this simple and sincere business. 
I am Mrs Floxy Page, the legal wife of the elstwhile chief security officer to late major Johnny Page, My Husband was the former head of the presidential guard to Mr Charles Taylor the liberia president. Before the death of my Husband, on may 15th,2003 during an attempt by the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor, where he was brutally injured and subsiquently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death,he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$18Million dollars (Eighteen million dollars)that he used my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. Right now, the rebels are at war with the !
 president and the 
America government has asked the president to step down. I am now in cotonou-Republic of Benin as a refugee because i am being sought after by the rebels since my husband was seen as one of Taylor's strong men as they want to wipe out our family. In this respect,i am honourably seeking your assistance in thefollowing ways : 
1.To present yourselve as my beneficiary and next of kin to the fund,since i am hiding my identity from the authority to avoid them confisicating the fund or sending it back to Liberia. 
2.To serve as a trustee to the fund.
3.To make arrangement for me to come over to your country as an investor and to secure Residence permit in your county.Moreover, I will like us to agree on what might be your compensation for your effort input after the successful claiming of this fund.You can get in contact with me through my alternative email:floxypage444@hknetmail.com after 
establishing cordial relationship. 
Anticipating to hear from you soon.

1,"Hello,

I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude
in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you
read this, don't feel sorry for me, because it is the destiny of everyman to
die someday. I am Jaron Abbas a business merchant based in Scotland. I have
been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about
a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not
particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not
even myself), but my trade. Though I am very well to do, I was never open
handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had
hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more
to life than just prosperity.

I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world, I would
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is
imminent, I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and
extended family members, as well as a few close friends. I want God to be
merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity
work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far, I have been able to
reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore, Algeria and
Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do  
this myself
anymore.

I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those
organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they
refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.

The last of my belonging which no one knows of, is the huge deposit of Two
Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe  
keeping company
abroad, which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.

You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.de

Johannesburg, South Africa.
 
Dear Sir,
 
RE:  MR. KENNETH FUZANE DANIEL NYERERE
BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
I do foresee the surprise this letter will bringto you as it comes from a stranger. But be rest assured as it comes with best of intentions. However, your address was courtesy of a business journal at the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg. But after ueconsideration from your profile, I became aware and  assured of your credibility of handling this trust and  my future.Thus, after my humble decision to solicit  for your understanding and co-operation in this  transaction, as it will be beneficial to all of us involved. My name is  MR. KENNETH FUZANE DANIEL NYERERE from Tanzania. 
   
 I am the son of the Late President of Tanzania, JULIUS MWALIMU NYERERE who died about two years ago.  My father used his position then to make for himself and us the family some fortune. My father died after a protracted illness. I was studying overseas when my  father died and I was forced to return for the  funeral. His attorney notified me and my family about  my father's WILL with his chambers.   
When I was going through the WILL, I discovered that my late father had used his  position  then to make some  money, which he brilliantly transferred and deposited with a private Security company here in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa. 
 
He deposited this consignment as valuables.The Security Company does not know that this consignment contains cash money, except the attorney and I. The amount is (Eighteen  million United States Dollars USD 18,000,000.00 MILLION). However, my aim of contacting you is for you to help me lodge the whole  sum into your nominated account in your country or any other part of the world. Secondly, you will also help me look for profitable investment overseas because I don't have knowledge of  international investments. 
 
As a result of my present situation, I won't be able to conclude this transaction alone. If you are interested in helping me out, try and contact me with the above telephone number or my above  e-mail address indicating your interest to help me,not forgetting to include your private phone and fax numbers for easier communication. I will then
 furnish you with more details. 
  
I have mutually agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum for your ssistance,   Then the remaining 75% will remain for my family and I, which you will help us invest. Be informed that this transaction needs utmost trust and confidentiality. Note also that the transaction attracts no risk on your side hence all the modalities for safe, smooth and successful transaction have been arranged by me.
 
Looking forward to receiving your urgent reply. 

Yours faithfully
for:  THE FAMILY OF LATE JULIUS MWALIMU NYERERE

1,"Dear Sir,/Madam , I am Princess Adama Williams, daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonmie Williams, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 28 years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria.  After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wave by the late director General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in August 27th last year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has Twenty Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars (USD23, 560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Security vault company in London. He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father'properties, Companies e.g., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that traditionally; if he dies we cannot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistance and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of God, you will help us move this money out of London to any country of your choice where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE

This letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne out of my sincere
desire to share a mutual business relationship with you. First, your strictest
confidence in this transaction is highly solicited. This is by virtue of
its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

We are top government official with a statutory corporation and members
of an ad hoc committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review
contract awarded by past administration. In the course of identifying, scrutinizing
and recommending for the payment of all valid contract executed, we discovered
a huge sum of money amounting to USD41.5M (Forty One Million five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars) on grossly over invoiced contract already awarded and
executed for the Department of Petroleum Resources. Having Cleaned the 'AUGEAN
STABLE' we intend to transfer the balance of USD41.5M presently floating
in our apex bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and advantage.

However, we request for your unwavering assistance in this regard because
as civil servants we are prohibited under the civil service code of conduct
bureau from operating a foreign account or running a foreign company unless
after retirement in this vain we want you to front for us as partner to
enable us lodge the funds speedily into your account. Bear in mind that
no risk is attached to this project and all logistics are in place and modalities
worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated time. This is in
accordance with the fact that you must never betray the trust already reposed
on you. We have decided to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for
your support, 60% for us while 10% for miscellaneous expenses (local and
international).

Please, provide your confidential phone and fax number to enable my boss
(Dr. Robert Swafa) contact you for further discussion on this matter to
his private email address: (r_swafa1@lycos.com)

Please advise in your return e-mail if any time is confidential enough to
call you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Mrs Elizabeth Ogali

Compliments Of The Season 2006,

     Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and 
may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent and 
writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional data base 
found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity.

     After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you 
among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that God has a way of helping who is in need.

   I am (Joe Kekabu Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 

You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

REQUEST FOR A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL BUSINESS 
RELATIONSHIP:PERMISSION TO REMIT US$35MILLION INTO YOUR COMPANY OR 
PRIVATE ACCOUNT. 
 
With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this 
proposal believing that it will receive the most 
desired attention from you even as we have not had any 
previous correspondence before. 
 
Although I am constrained by insufficient information 
about you, but I will express in full the main 
objectives of this proposal. 
 
This request for your assistance is of mutual benefit 
to us all. Our company is specialized in contract 
syndication, projects consulting, 
monitoring/supervision and management services. We 
would like to solicit your kindness in assisting us to 
champion the transfer of some fund from our country to 
yours for safe keeping. The total amount of fund is 
US$35million (Thirty-five Million United States 
Dollars Only). 
 
SOURCE OF THIS FUND: 
We have used our network of relationships, to secure a 
contract valued at US$350,000,000.00 (THREE HUNDRED 
AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) from the 
Federal Ministry of Works & Housing (F.M.W.H.). This 
contract was in favour of a Foreign based 
Multi-national company. This contract has been fully 
executed and the contractors have already received 
their payments from the Ministry of Works & Housing. 
 
However, before the contract was awarded, we had 
understanding with officials of Federal Ministry of 
Works & Housing, that 10% (TEN PERCENT) of the total 
contract sum would be our commission for our services 
in recommending the contractors and for helping to 
conduct various negotiations leading to final 
agreement. This 10% amounting to US$35,000,00.00 
(THIRTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) is 
due for payment to a foreign account of our choice. 
This amount is owned by our goodselves and some top 
officials of Federal Ministry of Works & Housing. 
 
Basically, you would be required to nominate a 
suitable Bank Account that will conveniently 
accommodate the total fund. Account could be a fresh 
or an already existing one, and could be individual or 
corporate account. All necessary arrangement have been 
made for the transfer of the funds into your account 
which they are awaiting for your above mentioned

Hello,
 
Good day to you the complement of today. i am happy to request for your assistance and also  to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.
 
I am Miss Aicha Kone,22 years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA KONE. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. 
 
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten million  United State Dollars.(USD$10 million) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons. 
 
I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
 
1. Can I completely trust you? 
2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you? 
 
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
 
Thank you so much. 
 
My sincere regards,

 contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued
 at US$15.4 Million left behind by my client before it
 gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the
 Security Finance Firm where this huge amount were
 deposited.

 The said Security Finance Company has issued me a
 notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account
 confisicated within the next twenty one official

 locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
 the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the
 deceased since you bear his last names, so that the
 proceeds of this account can be paid to you.

 Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
 shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities

1,"COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON, 
With due respect, trust and humility I write this letter to you seeking your help and assistance though it s difficult 
since we have not met before. I believe that you are capable and reliable in handling this urgent 
international transaction of this sort. I am VIVIAN KABA, the dougher of comrade TOMSIN KABA 
the Zimbabwean former Minister for Youth & Gender Equality who is also a businessman and politician, in the Zimbabwean political arena. My father was the famous politician who stood firm against President 
Mugabe 's idea of continuous seizure of White farms and the distribution of it to the blacks without compensation to the owners. Because of my father's stand in this issue, he was killed on the 14th April 2001 by a planned motor accident along Mashonaland in Western Mashona province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the accident are said 
to be dissidents soldiers suspected to have the backing of the government and President Mugabe. Sir, when this accident occurred at about 10:15 am Zimbabwean time my 
father did not die on the spot rather he was rushed to Harare hospital by some members of the opposition group. 
Sensing that if my father dies we shall be the next target, my mother in her sick condition managed under special arrangements by some UDM members (the opposition group) managed to sneak us out of Zimbabwe to DAKAR SENEGAL where we are to seek asylum. It was at this stage that my mother confided in me that my father, before he died, had released certain documents to her. One of these documents is the main reason iam writing this letter to you, and it concerns a deposit of one diplomatic box my father concealed with one of the private security company here in dakar containing US$15M (fifteen million, united states dollars) declared as family valuables, and other vital 
documents which was meant for his political campaign in the past election march 2002. We are now in DAKAR SENEGAL with the original documents of deposit intact, and because of the existing law, which prevents asylum seekers / refugee like us to operate an account that exceeds US$1000.00 and at the same time, there is no way we can comfortably transfer this money abroad for safe keeping and investment without assistance from someone overseas, I decided to write to you seek for your help for this money to be transferred into your private bank account 
as all arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care of. I want to a ssure you also that this transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this box apart from my younger borther and i as my 
mother .Sir, as for your reward kind assistance we have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under your guidance. If you are willing to help us, try as much as possible to reach me with the above number for more briefing, and also, to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding the transfer. However you will be kind enough to give me 
your private number, I will be glad to call you. Sir, bear in mind that our lives depend on this fund and we do hope 
that this money will be safe when finally transferred into your account. I do hope to establish a rewardi ng and good relationship with you and your family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. Thanks for your co-operation and God bless. Best regards, Email.(vivian_kaba05@yahoo.co.com)

Dear  friend,

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before neither in
person nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes just one day to meet
or know someone either physically or through correspondence.
I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as  
being quite
astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr. Liu Yan a transfer  
supervisor
operations in investment section in Bank of China Ltd. Secretariat of  
the BOCHK
Charitable Foundation 13/F. Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong  
Kong I have
an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war  
our client
General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also  
business man
made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Nineteen
million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war. Again
after the war another notification was sent and still no response came  
from him.
We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim Ali and his family had been
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.After further
investigation it was also discovered that General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not
declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his
bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my  
office that
no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and  
no one will
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that, according  
to the to
the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali  
so that you
will be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had  
everything
planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney
that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of
kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at  
this stage
is for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number  
and Address
so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made  
the next of
kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the
necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the
funds to an account that will be provided by you with my guidiance.There is no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized  
method and
the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we
shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If you are interested please
send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address.

Kind Regards

Liu Yan.

I am Mr Henry Kabore manager audit account department of African Development Bank(A.D.B.) .
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in an aeroplane crash.
Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
And our banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund. 
 
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner a citizen  Burkina Faso cannot stand as next of kin.
If you accept my proposal to do this deal to the end i will give to you 30% of the total money will be for you as a foreign partner while 10% will be set aside to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the process of transferring the fund to your nominated bank account. 
 
If you're willing to handle this deal with me kind get back to me with your Private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications well as your personal picture or a copy of your international passport to enable me know whom Im dealing with. 
 
Note: I demand the highest trust from you to keep this business strictly confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't know that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim.
At the end of this transaction which will be when the money will hit your account safely i will then come over to your country for sharing the fund according to the previous agreed percentage, you might even have to advice me on possibilities of investment in your country.

I am expecting  your urgent reply so that i will send to you an  application form which you will fill and send  directly to the bank.

Dear Good Friend,
  
With much sincererity of purpose I make this contact
with you in this divine year of 2006 as I strongly
believed in spiritual expect of life that control the
physical and the divine nature that governs the
universe.


My name is Dr.Emmanuel mbeti.. an accountant in a reputable bank
in ECOBANK Benin Republic West Coast Africa.  I am
contacting you with the hope of having a private and
confidential  business with you. I am writing you to
ask for your assistance in the transfer of  USD
(10.3.m) Ten Million, Three Hundred Thousand
Dollars.  Before I go further with my request I will
like to inform you that I would loved if  we could
discuss this transaction through Telephone due to its
magnitude, I am taking this urgent move in order to
make an acquaintance with you prior to the time I will
be due for an official assignment in Europe But first
I will like to put in the light of this transaction.


Durring the course of our Auditting Earlier January
2006 , I discovered a floating fund in an account
opened in the bank in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records, I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL], 
Hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this
money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.


The owner of this account Mr. Morris Thompson an
American Citizen and a great industrialist and a
resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in
the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crahsed on January 31 2000, including his wife and
only daughter leaving nobody to claim the money. You
shall read more news about the crash on visiting this
site
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
and 

http://www.alaskaair.com/E_latest.asp


No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that the
account is a secret account.
  

The total amount involved is Ten million Three Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars only [$10,300.000.00]
and I wish to transfer this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any
foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local
person here, but to a foreigner who has information
about the account, which I shall give to you upon your
positive response.

I am revealing this to you with believe in God that
you will never let me down in this business, you are
the first and the only person that I am contacting for
this business, so I need urgent response so that we
shall proceed to next step . I' ve reposed my
confidence in you with hope you will never let me down
now or in the future.

FROM: Mr George Adams
Audit and Accounting Officer
ECOBANK BENIN , Rue du Gouverneur Bayol,
01  BP 1280-Cotonou
my Private email address is;godbless22@sify.com

Calvary Greetings,

I am Mr. George Adams Audit Manager ECOBANK of AFRICA BENIN . In the capital
city of Cotonou Benin republic, and assistance, this is a very confidential
proposition for you. On April 21st 1999, A Swedish Oil consultant/contractor
with the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr.Soren Anderson made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity on
November 20th 2003 as his Credit Officer, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and
finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Benenoise Solid Minerals
Corporation that Mr.Soren Anderson died on auto accident with his entire
family.

Further investigations and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
Again, I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Soren Anderson did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

This sum of US$15,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank No one will ever come
forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics, codes and
Laws, at the expiration of 7(Two) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as
the next of kin to Mr.Soren. This is simple, I will like you to respond
immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
70% for me and some of my colleagues who are aware of this transaction and 25%
for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction There is
no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by my
colleagues and with my position as the Foreign Remittance Director guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction.

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should
observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to
invest my share in your country.

LAGOS NIGERIA.

ATTN:SIR,

      REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE- STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

 I am Dr VINCENT UMEH, an accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources 
(MPR) and a member of a three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review and 
payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to 
handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but exercise patience and 
read on. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium Multinational 
in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of Petroleum Resources among which 
were: 

1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down stream 
products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in 
the country~ US$ 152Million. 

3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 
Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced 
to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and 
is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed 
these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. 
consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to 
your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are 
prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening 
operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on you 
at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the 
transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal 
& External) between the parties in the course of the transfer. We will mandate 
you to draw up an investment plan for us of which you will control since we 
cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in 
real estate in your country. You must however note that this transaction is 
subjected to the following terms and conditions: 

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence. 

2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality because of the circumstances we now find ourselves. 

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have 
absolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the 
presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the 
funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above stated 
terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord this 
transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the parties 
involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be officially and 
legally processed with your name or the name of your company you may nominate 
as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of 
contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to invest these 
funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be ofimmense help in 
this regards. Kindly expedite action so as to enable us include this 
transaction into this batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually 
carried out on quarterly basis. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my 
private e-mail address: vumeh703@yahoo.com

Best regards,

THE BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)ANNEX
OUAGA-BURKINA FASO.

I am Alima  Ahmed, the manager in charge of auditing and accounting unit 
foreign remittance department of bank of africa (BOA)ouaga-burkina faso in 
west Africa.
With due respect and regards I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the 
transaction ,During our investigation and auditing in the bank, in my 
department I came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased 
person, a foriegner who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant 
in his account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody 
either from his family or relation before my discovery to this 
development,Although personally, I kept this information secrete within 
myself and  to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and uccessful 
during the time of execution.

The amount involved is (us$7,500.000) (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand 
United State Dollars ). Meanwhile, all the whole arrangement and directives 
needed to put claim over this fund as the next of kin to the deceased, Upon 
your acceptance all the information will be forward to you as soon as you 
indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your 
self to this great business opportunity,In fact, I could have done this deal 
alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are 
not allowed to operate a foriegn account and would eventually raise an eye 
brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank, 
this is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to 
the bank and also present a foriegn account where you will need the said 
fund to be transferred into, after due verification and clarification to 
designated bank account,I will not fail to inform you that this transaction 
is 100% risk free, On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be 
entitled to 40% of the total sum as ratification, while 10% will be set 
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer 
such as telephone bills etc,While 50% will be for me.

Please you have been adviced to keep top secret as I am still in service and 
intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you, I will be 
monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money 
in your account and ask me to come down there for subsequent shearing of the 
fund according to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment,either in your country or any other country you may advice me to 
invest in.
All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you, I 
suggest you get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this 
deal.

ATTN: Dear Friend, 

Before I introduce myself, I 
wish to inform you that this letter is not 
a hoax mail and I urge you 
to treat it serious. 

I am Mr.Johnson Kerosine, a personal assistant 
to Mr.Wallter Hangal, 
the managing director of WALHANG ELECTRODE 
COMPANY LONDON England. 

I am Mr.Wallter Hangal's personal assistant 
for six years now;

Mr.Wallter Hangal is the managing director 
of WALHANG ELECTRODE COMPANY

tsunami incident in Thailand together with 
his wife and three blessed 
children on 26th December 2004, since after 
the incident I have been 
trying to locate any of his relation or brother, 
I later discovered 
that Mr.Wallter Hangal is the only issue to his 
family. 

Before his 
death on 26th December 2004 Mr.Wallter Hangal left with a 
bank a total 
sum of $58 million United State Dollars. I came across your 
name and 
contact, on the course of my personal searching for reliable 
and 
honest person whom will transact this business with me so i decided 
to 
contact you for this project. 

I am contacting you to assist in 
repatriating and securing the wealth 
left behind in a fixed deposit 
account by Mr.Wallter Hangal before they 
get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the Bank. 

The board of the directors n the Bank has 
issued a notice that after 2 
months from now and no next of kin shown 
up for the claim, the funds 
will be confiscated and declared 
unserviceable. 

Since I the personal assis tant have been unsuccessful 
in locating 
Mr.Wallter Hangal's relatives for sometime now, I seek 
your consent to 
present you as the Next of Kin of the deceased since 
you are a foreigner, 
so that the proceed of this deposit valued at 
$USD 58 Million Dollars 
can be released to you. 

The Bank will 
release the funds to any foreigner who has all related 
information/documents of Mr.Wallter Hangal . I myself have 
successfully 
gotten all the necessary documents and contacts of his 
account with the 
bank, Your application will be directed to his 
account officer 
department For verification and approval. Everything 
is under my control. 

I shall Provide you all the information and copy 
of the certificate of 
deposit issued o Mr.Wallter Hangal when he 
deposited the funds in the 
Bank. 

I shall also involve a good 
attorney who shall represent you in all the 
appropriate offices for 
the claim. I shall destroy all the documents 
used for the claim and 
leave no traces. Af ter everything, you shall have 
30% of the total 
sum, while 70% for me. All requires is your honest 
cooperation to 
enable us seeing this business successful. 

I guarantee that this will 
be executed under a legitimate arrangement 
that will protect you from 
any breach of the law.

Mr.Wallter Hangal was a very good man and it is 
not wise to allow his 
hard earned wealth to be stolen by the reedy 
directors of the bank. 

Further details awaits your response by email. 
Please treat this 
proposal very strictly and confidential. 

Best 

Regards and God bless you.

1,"I am Mr. John Nlobo, Bank Manager of United Bank For
Africa , Capetown Branch. I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6
1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the 
Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a
numbered time (Fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd
that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found
out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim
Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
come forward to claim it. According to the South
African
Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the South African
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim
Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately
with your full names and address so that the attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,
which will put you in place as the next of kin. I
would also like you to scan you drivers license for
me.

We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk
at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon
your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant
documents that will help you understand. Please
observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that
this transaction would be most profitable for both of
us because I shall require your assistance to invest
my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via email.

Re: Tranfer of ($12,800.000. USD) twelve million eight hundred thousand united states dollars only.
I want to transfer abroad ($12,800.000. USD) twelve million eight thousand united states dollars, from-guaranty trust bank plc, lagos-Nigeria. i want you to help or look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing account or open or set up new one immediately to receive this floating fund from my bank here in lagos, even an emty account can serve to receive the money, as long as you remain honest to me till the end of this important business transaction.
I want to believe you will not let me down now or after the fund transfer to your account.

 I am aderoju muyiwa the audit/surpervisor, guaranty trust bank , lagos-Nigeria. during the course of auditing i discorvered a floating fund in an account opened since 1993 and also since 1996 nobody has operated this account again. after going through some files in the record, I discorvered that the owner account died without a living [Heir], hence the money has being floating and if i do not remit the money out urgently it will be forfeited to the goverment for nothing.
The owner of the account Mr Allan miller,a foreigner and an industrialist,died since 1996 with his wife who is his next of kin,that is why nobody has come to ask for the money, my investigation proved to me as well that the late Allan seaman until his death was the managing director of diamond safari  [pty] sa.
With the particulars that you will provide, i will change all his banking docs to yours and start the fund transfer process to your account,but first you have to give me your word that you will not let me down like i said before and also agreement signed between us.

We will start the first transfer with six million dollars [$6,000.000.] upon succesfull transfer without any disappointment from your side,we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining six million eight hundred thousand united states dollards, [$6,800.000.] into your account bringing the total to twelve million eight hundred united states dollars [$12,800.000.].
 I am contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport, drivers particulars and with foreign account because the fund is in dollars and the former owner of the account,late Mr Allan seaman is a foreigner.

I will like us to sign a binding agreement that will bing us together in these deal, I am revealing this to you with the believe that you will not let me down, You are the first and only person I am contacting as regards this business, so please reply urgenly for me to brief you on the next step to take.
You should forward your private telephone and fax numbers and your banking details that will be needed for the transfer of the money.you will have to give me the assurance that this money will be intact pending my arrival physically in your country for sharing/disbursement of the fund which will be 35% for your assistance, 60% will be for us and 5% will be set aside for expenses that will be incured by both parties during the course of the fund transfer to your account.
 I look forward to your earliest response through my  private email address given below aderojumuyiwa@ecplaza.net for security reasons.

1,"Dear Friend.

I am Mrs Janet Bradford, am a widow and an International Oil merchant in
Dubai, United Arab Emirate and a member of Project Management Institute. I
have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late due to my
laxity in caring for my
health. It has defiled all forms of medical attention ; Right now I have
only about a few months to live, according to my Medical Consultant from
Germany. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really
cared for myself but for my the Oil business just because of the fact that
am a Widow with no feeling for love and sex from any man since i had lost
my lovely husband years ago!.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business
as that was the only thing I cared for since i lost my lovely husband 12
years ago!. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to
life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believed when God gives me a second chance and heal me I would livemy
life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my
healing and have willed and given most of myproperties and assets to my
immediate and extended family members and
as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I havedecided
to give arms to Charity Organizations and give succor and comfort to the
less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want
this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth so far, by
distributing some of this money to some Charity Organizations in India.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my
selfanymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts
in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to Charity
Organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan. They cashed
the money but kept it only to themselves. Hence I do not trust them
anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them
already.

The last of my funds/money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit
of Twenty Two Million United States Dollars ( US$ 22 Million) that Ihave
in the Vault of The Security Company in Europe as family valuablesince the
year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf
anddisburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia and for the less
privileged. Please sendme a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in
this disbursement. Iwill set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts.
I need your
urgent reply with the below complete information

Your Full names:
Your Residential Address:
Your phone/Fax numbers:
Your Age:
Your Occupation:

As soon as I receive this from you it will enable me go ahead andinform
the company where the said fund is deposited for the project.Be informed
that I will make sure I do all I can to ensure that thisproject work out
in the name of God .I will also plead to you to always pray for me because
only God can heals. I will advice you to also send your reply to my below
company email adress.


God bless you for your care and understanding.Attached to this email is my

1,"Sir,
 
I was privileged to come across your contact through my personal check with your country Investment Portal and I decided that I should establish a communication with you to acquiring some information on lucrative investment or establishment in your country. 
Be it as it may, I will appreciate if you can be of good assistance to me as I am willing to invest my money with you in your country provided I will have a good partner or investor as well fund manager who will guild on this business framework and as thus, share with me the dividend in any venture which we have considered lucrative to invest in and I have not managed any business before but have always dream of running my own establishment hence my desire to recapitalize in your country Investment market either in oil or real estate. 

Further to this, I will like to give you a little more information about me, I am an American but married into the Sharjah Royal Family here in Sharjah United Arab Emirate, but at the moment undergoing a divorce case with my husband through the sharia court and hopefully will get this matter over within a couple of weeks and that is why I want to calve a niche for myself to be able to continue with my life and make my life meaningful when I leave my husband�s family. The funds I intend to invest with you is currently in a UAE bank here as was deposited by my late father who worked before he died as a chemical engineer in the Saudi Oil Corporation ARAMCO and later the Emirate National Oil Corporation ENOC. 

My reason of trying to establish my own business is necessitated by the advent of my divorce suite with my husband and according to the sharjah marital law here, if my husband family gets any knowledge of the funds in the bank, they will take possession of the funds since my father used my name as the next of kin. 

It is my wish to handle this matter privately under the most cautious legal arrangement to get the funds into your possession before we can commence any trade deal and therefore demand that you kindly give me a brief information about you with pictures, contact address and telephone numbers incase I want to call you . 

Pls can you tell me if you can deal with my lawyer who practice in Abu Dhabi � U.A.E as the funds I wish to invest into the business is in a bank there and I will like to get you introduced to my lawyer who is also an American and works with the emirate international law firm. the money in question (US$9,750,000) was deposited into the bank about two years back before my father died of heart failure and ever since his death, my relationship with my husband has gone bad due to the fact that I�ve been married to him for six years now and we have no issue. 

My lawyer advised that what we shall do is to portray you as an investor who has given that money to my father before he died for a crude oil lifting from the Saudi oil corporation but the deal was thwarted due the sudden death of my father. 

By this strategy, the lawyer will present some letter of administration and application to the bank for the release of the funds to you under the emirate inheritance law. This logistics is to get the funds transferred to you as the bonafide owner of the funds to avoid any implications that will not permit me as being married to the royal family to possess such chattel or estate of my late father in conformity with the sharia marital law. 

So I hope you understand very well, the strategies and where you don�t quite comprehend, do ask me for more clarifications and for your involvement I will pay you 15% of the total money for your consultancy and then we can invest the rest still under your supervision.Please reply me at info_alqaspat@z6.com

I await your utmost response.

COMPLIMENTS OF THE DAY MA/SIR.

I am JOHN MOKA the chief accountant of Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa (ABSA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1999 and since 
2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old 
files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. 
Morris Thompson, a foreigner, Business Man and a miner at Kruger Gold 
Company, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000. Ever then no 
other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has 
no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this 
company does not know anything about this account and the money involved is 
One hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 136 Million).  
I want
us to first transfer US$ 36 Million from this money into your safe
overseas account before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be 
approved to any foreign account because the money is in United States 
Dollars and the former owner Mr. Morris Thompson is a foreigner too. I know 
that this message will come to you as surprise as we don�t know ourselves 
before.

We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine
business. You can view the web site bellow for more information on our late 
client.

http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

I only got your contact information from my secretary who operates
computer; with believe in God that you will never let me down in this 
business, considering my position as a public servant. You are the only 
person that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so 
that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your 
private telephone and fax numbers including the full details of your account 
to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face-to-face and sign a 
binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money 
into your account where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your 
country for withdrawal and sharing and other investment.

Meanwhile, I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner 
with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation 
to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this 
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which 
I will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate with 
me, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust 
according to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because this 
opportunity may never come again in my life. I need a truthful and God 
fearing person in this business because I don�t want to make a mistake so I 
need your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I don�t
want anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should make 
secrecy and confidentiality our primary working condition, bearing in mind 
that I am a public servant. I will also use my position and influence to 
effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account 
with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange 
department.


At the conclusion of this business, you will be giving 25% of the total
amount, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred the process of the transfer. I look forward to your
earliest reply.

Yours sincerely,
JOHN MOKA

While i leave this country as well for my life security.
   Now,i solicit you with my sincere desire to come to my aid in order for:
(1)to move this money out of this country to your's.
(2)to also look out for me what the money can be invested on.

I greet you in the Name of GOD. 
I am MRS DEBORAH WILLIAMS from South Africa.I am married to Late MR DAVID WILLIAMS of blessed memory who was an oil explorer in Kuwait and Brunei for fifteen years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for twelve years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted to our God and respect other who serve him. Since his death, I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems. When my late Husband was alive he Deposited the sum of $18.5million (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars) with a Deposit Company in Europe.the money is deposited as Family Valuables/Treasure for security reasons. 

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only six months to live due to my cancer problem, and this lead to a stroke attack which bother me most though because I cannot move as I use to. Having known my condition I decided to entrust this fund to either a philanthropic organization or devoted individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instructs herein.30% of the US$18.5million goes to you to ensure that you are prepared for the task ahead, 60% of this money will be used in all sincerity to fund philanthropic organization, orphanages, widows and 5% will go to the family Attorney who will prepare the Authorisation and the balance 5% sent to me to at least prepare for my funeral and off-set my medical bills. 
I am taking this decision because I don't have any child or devoted relations whose behavior has left much to be desired while I am ill and above all I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an UnGodly manner,hence this bold decision.

Since my health is Retrogressing by the minute, you will have to send your POSTAL ADDRESS, CONTACT PHONE NUMBER AND FAX and a little details about yourself, because I got your address from the internet after a thorough search.
As soon as I receive this information from you I will make arrangement to prepare the Authorization through the family Attorney for you to get Possession of the Deposit. As soon as I receive your reply to my confidential email address.
                 
                      deberahwilliams100@kaixo.com
and the authorization is given to you by me, I will give you the name and contact of the Deposit company where the money was Deposited in Europe, for claims to the consignment.

Until I hear from you, I pray that this letter bring you and your family good tiding while my dreams to help humanity rest squarely on your shoulders.

May the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. 
Remain Blessed,

I know that this mail will come to you as a
surprise,please accept the content in good faith. I
do not intend to cause any grief to you and your
family.The reason for sending this mail is very
fundamental because I and My Family are in serious problem 
and we need your help .My Name is Mrs Rachael oniga, daughter Of late Mr
Chico Oniga.

I am about to tell you something that I have not
discuss with anyone excluding my lawyer. My father was a big time
farmer in south Africa, he uses most of South Africa land for farming. The
Government in South Africa gave him those lands for farming and he will pay
back
when he have the money, it was like a loan they gave him the lands as loan
My
father was very successful In the farming business and he paid all the
Government
back. Some top officials In the Government were Jealous because of his
wealth. They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against
the Government but he refuse ,so they plan to kill him and claim all his
wealth he has suffered for, in South Africa. On his way home one day he was
coming from the office
and he was assassinated and he was rushed to the hospital by a good
Samaritan. But he did not
survive It .But before they killed him he saw It coming and transfer
most of his fund to a Security company In Holland. He died In the hospital
,But before he died he gave me the contact Information to the Security
company which the fund was located.

Those people were looking for me and my family and
we ran to Nigeria for safety because they know we know were my father
funds were hidden. I contacted the Security company
yesterday on how I could collect the funds with my lawyer assistance and
they told
me that I need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa because of Security
reasons. And I dont have anyone outside Africa that will stand for me as a
beneficiary. 
They said the money was too big (TWENTY MILLION USDOLLARS)My father never 
told me the amount of the money I was so shock. They also said that the
funds has been deposited there for about four years 
now and it has accumulated demurrage which we must pay before the
consignment will be released.

My lawyer told me to look for a beneficiary. That Is my problem
now, My mother Is willing to give Seven Million USDOLLARS to the you
if you will help the family. Please If you can help me and my family In
anyway I will appreciate It a lot and in paying the demurrage fee. I will
like to hear
from you soon , please contact me through my private address I have given

From: Mr Ali Sherif. African Development Bank (ADB)Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso . 
Dear Friend, 
I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa .
In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.
 
Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
 
It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.
 
the bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.
As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.
To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.
 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer. 
 
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Hoping to hear from you immediately.           PLANE CRASH WEB SITE... http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

DEAR:SIR/MADAM

I am Mr Joel Taylor I work with the office of the Director, Foreign 
Operation Department of Eco Bank NIG. PLC, Lagos Branch. It happened On the 
2nd of May 1999, Engr. S. BARNHILL, an AMERICAN  from New Orleans who used 
to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company In Nigeria (SPDC), Mr Engr. 
S. BARNHILL, his wife And their three children were involved in a car 
accident along Shagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, Eco Bank NIG. PLC have made 
several enquiries to  embassies to locate any of the extended relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives 
over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence 
I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money 
that belong to Mr Engr. S. BARNHILL, before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
$18.6 Million Dollars has issued a notice to provide the next of kin or have 
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

Since bank have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years 
now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, 
so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18.6 Million Dollars can be 
paid to you and then you and me can share the money,50% to me and 45% to 
you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require, 
I have the Certificate of deposit that can be used to back up any claim we 
may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this 
deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by 
my email to enable us discuss further.
Thank you

My Regards,

Joel Taylor

I am the Executive Investigation Chairman Committee on Review of Contracts Payments instituted by H.E. President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all contracts executed and payments made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha. I have been mandated by my colleagues on the Committee to seek your assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$31.5Million.  As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of his government embezzled billion of dollars through spurious contracts and payments to foreigners between 1993-1998, and this is now the subject of probe by my Committee. In the course of our review, we have discovered the sum of US$31.5Million,which the former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death on June 8, 1998. It is this amount that my colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your assistance. This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot acquire the fund in our names.  We have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free arrangement through which the fund can be transferred within a very short time, if you follow strictly our instructions. The plan is to use our position and influence on the Committee to present you as a foreign contractor beneficiary of the fund. We shall arrange all documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf. The arrangement is perfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the transaction can be concluded within 7-10 working days from when you agree to assist us.  You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through the above Telephone and Fax numbers Or E-Mail address so we can further discuss the modalities of your cooperation and negotiate the charge for your kindly assistance. You were highly recommended and You definitely have a lot to benefit from this transaction as we are prepared to give you 30% of the total funds as soon as you secure it in your Account.  Please, endeavour to give me your telephone/fax number(s)including a bank details  for  the  transfer of the  above  fund,through which we can communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the need for strict confidentiality is of essence to this transaction.

compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Yours faithfully

PRINCE GEORGE DUKE

1,"Greeting,

Sir,

I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.

My name is Martin Goudalé,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Goudalé, who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)""Bouake"" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.

You can find the story on this
website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm

On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.

After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.

That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .

Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce to the Finance House where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer.

I am waiting for your response.
Thanks and God bless.

1,"Hello my dear
 
I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO, a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.
 
The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.
Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.
 
Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.
 
 As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.
I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.
 
My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.
Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.
Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)

Hello,

It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but
to be precise I got your data from the your e-mail
site member directory in my search for a competent
business manager/hard working person who is willing
and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with
me in order to
execute a project which I am convinced that you are
capable and trusted to do this business with me.

I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and
I am from  River State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in
Public Administration and I work with GLOBAL SECURITY
& FINANCE LTD. I  have now developed the interest in
having a business investment outside Nigeria without
my employers knowing about it. Hence I contacted you
for friendship and business relationship.

The fund in question proposed for this project is
US$14.8million(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only), which I will like you to
receive it on my behalf and to invest it in your
business or in any business that you think will be
profitable in your country.

Please Note: This fund have been under a suspense
account pending the time it will be claimed by the
owner. It came as a result of a multi-natinal company
that we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some
years ago and after the contract, the company got paid
and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.

Now the time has come for me to process and move the
fund out for investment, but I can not do it on my own
since I am still working with the Global Security &
Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that I
can use you or your company to process the release of
the fund as if you are reciving a payment of an
executed contract.

Please let me know about yourself/company and also let
me know if you can be able to receive the money on my
behalf and invest it in your company or any good and
profitable business in your country without exposing
me, so as to give you all the details needed to make
the money transferred to you. 

Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I
will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses
that will be incurred in the cause of transfer.

Please write back if only you know you are capable
enough to execute this project with me.

Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address
is: markluke2@bareed.com           
  
Looking forward to your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke

1,"From;Mr.Daniel Kargbu and Family, 
         Lome. Republic of Togo. 

My Dear , 

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. 
My name is Mr.Daniel Smith Kargbu , the second son of Retired Major.George Smith Kargbu , of Monrovia Liberia,.At the height of the current political crises in our country,in which the rebel group of the opposition party in our country slain and ripp off the supporters of our president,Mr Charles Taylor,in their efforts to reclaim power in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 6th of July,2003, in their struggle to protect some civilians who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a retired major with our countrys army and a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the civilians by the rebel group in which they force the younger civilians to fight with guns and grenades and in the process loose either their lives or some parts of their body upon refusal !
 to take the ammunition for war.I therefore decided to move my mother and my younger sister and brother to the Republic of Togo for refuge,where we presently stay without anything and without any source of livelyhood. 


During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death with my elder brother in the night of that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving grown up son of my father,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Republic of Togo finally.And also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money before it is dictated out and blocked by the incoming regime in our country, and also to improve my familys worsening condition at present. 

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me; 

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to their office here in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear and accomodate this money for my family . 
2. To finally assist us in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years after I must have joined you first. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our unexpected bad situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help. 
Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. 

Best Regards, 
Mr.Daniel Kargbu and family.

Dear Friend,

I crave your indulgence for the unsolicited nature of this letter, but it 
was borne out of desperation and current development. please bear with me. 
My name is Mr.ADAMA IBRAHIM, an Auditor of African Development Bank I  
discovered existing dormant account for 5 years.

When I discovered that there had been no continuation nor withdrawals from 
this account for this long period and our banking law stipulates that any un 
serviceable account for more than 5 years will go into the bank revenue as 
an unclaimed fund.

I have made personal inquiries about the depositor and his next of kin but 
sadly, the depositor and his next of kin died in motor acident while the 
rest of the family died in Iraq during the crisis,I only made this 
investigation just to be double sure of this fact and since I have been 
unsuccessful in
locating the Relatives.

I seek your consent to Present yourself as the next of kin of the deceased. 
As an auditor in the bank I will use my position in the bank to help you 
becoming the next of kin to the estate, so that the proceeds of this account 
valued at $25.6 million dollars can be transfered to you, this is the story 
in a nutshell.

Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this funds. 
Thereafter, I will come for the sharing and investment, also to use part of 
the money to help the Iraqians, It is a careful network and for the past 
eleven months I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.

Now my questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible, All what I require is 
your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through, I guarantee 
that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, 
please get in touch with me by my e-mail to enable me outline to you the 
strategies on how to go about this, You may also send your phone number so 
that I can call you.

Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein be 
accorded the necessary
attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves, also send to me your 
personal information, to enable me send to you official text of application 
..

I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project. also call me.

You may be surprise to receive this letter from me, since you don?t know
me personally, I am Larry Amu The SON of DR Edward Amu, Who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact as I was searching
for a

Reliable person to handle a very confidential business which involve a transfer
of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father
was among the few black

Zimbabwean opposition party rich farmers murdered by the agents of the ruling
Government of president Robert mugabe, for his alleged support and sympathy
for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority, Before
the death of my

father, he had taken to Johannesburg and deposited the sum of thirty eight
million united state dollars (U$38,000,000 with a diplomatic company in
South Africa, and transfer to NETHERLAND(EUROPE), as if he foreseen the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as valuable
items (photographic material) to avoid over taxed custom clearance. These
land problems arose when president Robert mugabe introduced a new land act
that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned
the ideal. This result to rampant killings and mob action by the war veterans
and some political thugs, precisely more than three thousand( 3,000) people
have so far been killed. Heads of government from the west, especially Britain
and United States have voice their condemnation of Mugabe's plans. Subsequently,
south Africa have development community(S.A.D.C)has continuously supported
mugabe's new land act, I am face with the dilemma of investing this money
in the Netherlands because I am not having resident permit for fear of such
investment, Hence I am seeking for (political asylum) in the Netherlands,
I am looking for a business person whom I can entrusted this fund into his
hands for investment, I must let you know that this transaction is 100%
risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For
your assistance I am offering you 30% of the sum, 65% for me and my family,
while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incurred during
this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial properties based
on your advice. Finally, I will demand for assurance that you will not sit
on the money when it gets to your personal account or Company account in
your country, If this proposal is accepted please confirm your interest
by or sending me email with this email larryamu@netscape.net

Thanks.

1,"Dear Sir,
I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services.
Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion, 
frustration,and hopelessness. 
I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father.
The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with 
other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria. 
As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.

 MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU.
I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium. 

You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad. 
Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. 

I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping. 
This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account.
Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody 
irrespective of your relation with the person. 
Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za. 
Best regards
Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.

Accountant General, Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG)

Dear Sir

I want to belief that this Business Proposal, which was made with good 
intention will not to be a source of embarrassment to you, as you may've 
received similar type before.

I am extending this proposal to you in my capacity as Chief Accountant and 
in full agreement with the Auditor-General of this company (Nigerian 
Liquefied Natural Gas Company). After the third quarter internal audit 
carried on all records and accounts of awarded and executed contracts of 
this company (NLNG) since inception of democracy in Nigeria, a whopping sum 
of Thirty Two Million United States Dollars was uncovered to be floating. It 
might interest you to know that The Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company 
came into full working capacity during the current civilian dispensation at 
a working/asset capacity of Three Billion United States Dollars, and will 
definitely gulp more Two Billion United States Dollars on the completion of 
the fifth part.

The money (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars) has been approved for 
payment by this company NLNG, The Federal Ministry of Finance (Endorsed by 
the Accountant General of the Federation) and to be paid by the Apex Bank of 
Nigeria under Contract Number: NLNG/FGN/FMF/CBN/C987/04. As top civil 
servants, we are not authorized to operate Foreign Bank account hence our 
decision to use your account on full trust and confidence to transfer this 
money outside Nigeria. We have jointly agreed to transfer the funds into 
your account provided you will consent and prove that you can be trusted. I 
will regularize the approvals to reflect you as the beneficiary of the 
funds.

We have resolved to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% 
will also be used to defray all expenses that we will incurred in the course 
of this transaction, while we will invest our share of 70% into real estate 
development in your country, which you will manage for us pending our 
resignation from civil service. If you are capable of assisting with the 
transfer, please contact me immediately on my above information. PLEASE, YOU 
MAY ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT MY TRUST IN YOU AND ITS 
CONFIDENTIALITY BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION, SHOULD YOU NOT BE 
INTERESTED.

Very Best Regards.

Dr. Dan Kabo.

1,"Dear Friend,

I am delighted to write this letter, hoping you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation since I am convince you must be an honest and God fearing fellow who will help save my life and my only son,hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.
I am MRS M. MBEki, the wife of the late DR.MARTIN MBEKI,the former Chief Excutive and Group Director of PACIFIC BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA.
I am in possession of $6,500,000.00 (SIX MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS)which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding, this money in a security company, which I deposited as a family effect since 6th of Febuary 2000 after the death of my husband, is not an ill gotten wealth rather it was generated by my late husband from over twenty years of his Banking Service and business relationship.
On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will contact my son to instruct the Clearing House  to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bonafide owner/my next of kin to enable you retrieve the fund on behalf of me and my
family to your country to make good arrangement for any profitble joint business investment pending my arrival with my son to your country after you have transferred this fund.
Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties, assets and bank accounts bearing the MBEKI'S family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of South Africa. hence I will not want to be exposed for security reasons.
I am only revealing this to you with believing in God that you will not let me and my only son down now or in future if this money gets to you because this is the only hope of our future survival since our bread winner is 
no more.
For your knowledge, 1 % of this total amount has been set aside for all the expenses you might incure during the process of securing this fund. Example: TELEPHONE BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS,and other miscellenous expenses.
Try and negotiate for some profitable blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free which I think we can invest with part of this money when it is transferred.Personally I am interested in estate management and hotel business,please contact my son (SODINDO M MBEKI) who was lucky to escape from South Africa to Lome-Togo with the Certificate of the claim Deposit, where he is now staying as a refugee on his email address (sodindo@uboot.com) for detailed procedure.
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.
Yours sincerely,
MRS M MBEKI.

15 ARAFAT GRAND YOFF STREET,
United Nation Reserved Area 
(UNRA) DAKAR SENEGAL. 
 email rakiya_zubairu0202@yahoo.ca
(Assalam! )
Attn: ,
I know you will be surprised to read a letter from me but please 
Consider this as a request from a family in dare need of assistance. I am the 
wife of late Brigadier AL-Jubril Zubairu from Dafur Region, Sudan. My name 
is Hajia Rakiya Zubairu Writing to you from Sudan.
My son got your contact information from a business directory in 
Dakar Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And I on behalf of my late 
husband and my only son, decided to solicit for your assistance to 
transfer the sum of US$9 million dollars, from my late husband's trust 
account  with a bank in Senegal, into your company or Private bank 
account.
Before the death of my husband, he was a Brigadier in-charge of Arms 
and ammunition procurement for the Darfur Liberation Front (D. L. F.). In 
his will, he specifically drew my son's attention to the sum of US$9 
million, which he had deposited, in the vault of a Bank in Dakar Senegal , 
 as a family treasure, but it is truly cash while he boxed in it
the bank as a family treasure due to security reasons.
In fact, he said and I quote ?�my beloved son, I wish to draw your 
attention to the sum of US$9 million. I deposited the said fund in a 
private account of a Bank in Dakar , Senegal; all the documents 
regarding the fund are with your mother.
I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against 
the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and 
government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds 
and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I 
and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the 
President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as 
an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use.
When we divided the money, my share was US$9 million. I did this in 
case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubakar your two sisters and 
your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be 
serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care
of this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters
You should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign 
partner to assist you to transfer this money out of DAKAR for 
investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the 
deposit code, for you to claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; 
take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint 
me! Good-bye.
>From this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives 
and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful 
if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us 
clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the 
foreign partner of my late husband.  
 I am preparing to
travel to Senegal before the transaction continues, as the war is 
worsening more and more.
We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 
5% for the expenses that might be incurred in the course of the 
Transfer and the remaining 75% for the family investment abroad, which you 
will also assist us to materialize. Further information and Discussion 
about this transaction will commence as soon as you give us the assurance 
and
confidence that this money will be safe when transferred to your 
account and, please treat this
matter with urgency. Note that this transaction is 100% free from risk 
as our banker and lawyer have taking care of all the arrangements.

Thanks and May Allah Bless us.

Hello,

It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request. I am writing you to solicit your assistance in a business partnership that could be of mutual benefit to both of us. I hope that you read thoroughly and response as promptly as possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 Project Allocation, received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign contractors, whose contract payments are pending since the period of the past government of Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present government.

The purpose of this presidential order is that the present South Africa elected government will pay foreign contractors all debts owned, and thus maintaining a good relationship with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. In light of the above, my partner and I duty is to compile a list of these contractors. We have decided to include a company name with a bill of {USD25 Million United State Dollars} along side other company names and their respective bill for payments. The {Alliance Mining SA PTY}, which was incorporated for this operation, also carried out contractual works for the ministries as well as others.

With the co-operation of top senior partner of mine we are confident that our claim of {USD25Million} shall be granted being for contract work executed at the Ministry of Minerals and Energy, payment shall then be transferred upon approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words, if you accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the pertinent documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract already executed, for which your company shall be paid the sum of USD25Million. Please be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. Government official's employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank account abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign partner.

However, the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounced, which I will personally explain to you by fax or telephone if you agree to be our partner to determine your true position. I have the authority and consent of my partner to offer this transaction to you. You will be highly compensated with a percentage upon mutual agreement by both parties after a successful completion of this project. Further information concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response to this letter.

I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this payment claim possible, provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect financial resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance in the successful execution of this transaction, endeavour to contact me immediately by the above alternative email address because we will not compromise this transaction with any form of exposure, as we are still in active civil service.

Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we can not afford any political problems.

Thank you and God bless, as I await for a long term mutually beneficially relationship for both of us.

Yours Faithfully

Dr Abraham Maliba.

FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
FALOMO, IKOYI - LAGOS.
ATTN: Dear sir/madam,

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division.
We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of
Works and Housing,(FMWH),Federal Ministry of Finance
and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review
Panel (CRP) set up by the Federal Government of
Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the
pastmilitary administration.

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered
this fund which resulted from grossly over-invoiced
contracts which were executed for theFMW&H during the
last administration. The companies that executed the
contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
commissioned leaving the sum of US$17 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria ready for payment.
I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$17M
legally subcontracting the entitlement to your
company. This is bearing in mind that our civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning
foreign company or running foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account:
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as
thebeneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection
for reimbursment to both parties for incidental
expences that may be incurred in the course of the
transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we
wish to commence an importation business inconjunction
with you ).
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information: Your company
name, address, company's details &
activities,telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers around the world is going to
bemade in your name.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my
e-mail address, stating your tel/fax number for
further details.Yours faithfully,

Engr.Emmanuel Azizi.

NB: Bank Account Details not necessary as
preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

0,Have you been practising your curtsey?
1,"Dear Sir/Madam
Compliment of the day to you .
I got your contact through business search from the internet.
I am Mrs.Kate Masul, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch
. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th
2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek
made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at
TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next
of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.
This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will come forward to claim it.
According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies
to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to
assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael
creek,
so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the
hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the services of an  attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous
expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary
paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.
Best Regards.
Mrs.Kate Masul

       I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the
Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.

Considering his very strategic and influential
position, he would want the transaction to be as
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants
his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now,
until the completion of the transaction. Hence our
desire to have an overseas agent.

I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would
agree to act as our overseas agent in order to
actualize this transaction.

The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we
intend to carry out our proposed investments in your

Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria)
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to
your country in a convenient bank account that will be
provided by you before we can put the funds into use in
your country. For this, you shall be
considered to have executed a contract for the Federal
Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for which
payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The
contract sum of which shall run into US$26.4 Million,
of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be
our overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring
some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve
as our agent.

In the light of this, I would like you to forward to
me the following information:

1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number for easy
communication.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance of
this proposal through my above stated email address or my private email:
david_roy12@yahoo.com
after which we shall discuss in details the modalities
for seeing this transaction through.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

Greeting,

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Yours faithfully

all, I had gave the Security Company a call and was confirmed that the
boxes are intact.

children invest these funds on our behalf the sum of US$18.2 Million (and

such, I will be grateful if you can assist us. I am seeking your
assistance to invest this fund out of   Africa for investment purpose.

Dear Friend, 
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will
want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set
aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: mr4rezaabdulla@walla.com
 
 
God be with you.
Regards,
MR. REZA ABDULLA

TEL:27-83-508 5448
E-MAIL: prince_charleszuma@fsmail.net
ATTN:DIRECTOR/C .E. O
With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.
I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you.
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company.
This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.
This resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank.
As the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas.
I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.
If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately on the above telephone or by email. Finally, please treat this matter as urgent and Confidential. I intend to leave this country soonest.
Thanks for your mutual co-operation. I expect your urgent response.
Best Regards,
PRINCE CHARLES ZUMA

South Africa.
Dear Sir,
I hope this meets you in good well. My name is Sizu Zamba  (Esq). a legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:
http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml & 
http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml
My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Russian Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twelve Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($12,200,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in South Africa. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. I have employed every method to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this exercise has proved unsuccessful.
After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The director of remittance of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.
I am convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.
I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Expenses or Taxes as may be required. I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.

(cheu_ngpui4010@yahoo.com.hk)

Dear Friend,

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of
operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business
suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity
several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year.

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response
came from him. We later find out that the Majorand his family had been
killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi
basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in
my bank.So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State
Dollar is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to
claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my
country at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to the
ownership of  the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as
a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you
will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin
to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is
for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the
attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of
kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and
secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for
the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a
legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue.

Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we
shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you be
interested please send me your full names and current residential
address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below

(cheu_ngpui4010@yahoo.com.hk)

And finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this
operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr. Cheung Pui.

1,"Greetings to you,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a 
day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name 
is Mr.Emme Harry. the present branch Manager of a bank here in Benin 
Republic West Africa. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing 
that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like 
I said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your 
assistance is required as a foreigner.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last 
December I was asked to take osition of a Manager of our branch in Cotonou 
who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a 
fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $18.1 
million that has not been operated on for the past 3 years. From my 
investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  HAJI 
EL JAMAL ZOUE, a citizen of Lebanon who died on the recent plane crash in 
Cotonou Benin republic on the 26th of Dec. 2003 You can seach the Webside.

site;http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html )

I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come 
forward to claim the money as next of kin to the Late Mr  HAJI EL JAMAL 
ZOUE, meaning that no one is aware of the account.

I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and 
that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and 
share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power 
influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the 
account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present 
you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk 
involved, the transaction will be executed undera legitimate arrangement 
that will protect you from any breach of law.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share 
the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me 
as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together, so as 
to give you more details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.
Meanwhile, I will like to speak with you on phone for more information.  
Please you are to keep this transaction a top secret in view of my sensitive 
position at the bank.

#NOTE: These are required of you.
(1) Your full Name.
(2) Your personal phone number.
(3) Your Address

Thanks and have a nice day.

Best regards,
Mr Emme Harry.

MR OLAJIDE LUCAS 
Gulf Coastal Internatoinal bank, 
Victoria Island Branch, 
Lagos, Nigeria. 
ATTN, 

I am MR OLAJIDE LUCAS Branch Manager with Bank of the North Victoria Island Branch Lagos Nigeria,I have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. 
On January 6,1999 a Foreign Oil Consultant and contractor with the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Mr. James Herbert by name made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$38.6M(Thirty Eight Million, Six Hundred United States Dollars Only) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in accordance with the Bank policy to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally wediscovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a Will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank,and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration 
of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. This prompted us to contact you.We will like to front you as the next of 
kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the 
sum of $38.6 million U.S Dollars that is presently in my branch.

I contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own and 
operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the money in the Security Company . 

We have unanimously agreed that 25% of the entire sum would be for you if you agree to take part in this profitable transaction,70% for me and 2 of my colleagues while the remaining 5% would be used to pay back the expenses that 
may be incurred during the course of the transaction by both parties 
after the fund has been claimed as the next of kin.

In the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction,there 
are some information would be needed from you to commence transaction.

FULL NAME,CONTACT ADDRESS,PHONE AND FAX NUMBER. 

The transaction is 100% risk free as all modalities has been perfected 
to ensure the hitch free success of the transaction. 

I await your urgent response 
THANKS FOR CO-OPERATION

Dear Friend



I am Sir John Kempwelch one of the Director of HSBC Bank, London, United Kingdom. On the 2nd of January 2005, I received a call that one of my customer died in the Tsunami Disaster with his wife and only child while on vacation at Phuket Island in Thailand. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my customer's extended relatives and until date have not succeeded. 

   

I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before it gets confiscated by our bank or declared unserviceable by our bank where this deposit is lodged. 



Now, the bank Directors has called a board meeting regarding this Fund. So my main motive right now is to share this great opportunity with you by presenting you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since all his banking details are with me as his personal Account Officer. And the deceased Account valued at US$17.5M



Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the biological relatives of my late client, I hereby seek your consent to present you to the bank as next-of-kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the proceeds of this account valued at  US$17.5M can be transferred to you as inheritance and thereafter, you and I can share the money; 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% will be donated to the Tsunami Disaster Charity Fund. 

   

We shall start the first transfer with US$5,000.000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars only), upon the successful actualization of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. I have the original copy of Certificate of Deposit of the funds, which will be used to substantiate our inheritance claims. All I require is your consent and honest co-operation to enable us see the deal through. 



Furthermore, I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please contact me if you are interested immediately via my personal email:jkpw1968@yahoo.co.uk to enable us commence on the transaction. 

  

Best regards, 

Sir John Kempwelch.

crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot 
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any  
foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the 
time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason 
why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the 
next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will 
need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after 
due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank 
where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank 
account.

I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I 
agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect 
to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses 
incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will 
visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you 
must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in 
the money will be remitted.

All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once 
started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full 
support.
This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any 
precaution there after.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter
reply to thi box. at;

Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours faithfully,
Mr,KAREM AHMED
Bill and exchange manager,
BANK OF AFRICA

24th July, 2003

Alternative email address: randebe@cote.azur.fr

Dear Friend 

I am Fadaka Randebe, Bank Official of Standard Trust Bank of
Nigeria , Adeola Odeku Branch. I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6
1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the 
Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a
numbered time (Fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd
that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found
out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim
Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian
Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim
Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately
with your full names and address so that the attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,
which will put you in place as the next of kin. I
would also like you to scan you drivers license for
me.

We shall employ the services of two attorneys for


drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk
at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch
official guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon
your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant
documents that will help you understand. Please
observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that
this transaction would be most profitable for both of
us because I shall require your assistance to invest
my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative  email address. 

Thanks and regards, 

Fadaka Randebe.

Dear Friend.
Greetings, With warm heart I offer my friendship and I hope this mail meets you in good time, however strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, for I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. I am Mr Patrick F.Massaquoi the son of late formal Liberia sport minister Mr Francois Massaquoi, who was killed while in office in 2001.

After the death of my father, the Charles Taylor control government have been providing my family with security, but resently the united nations and the united state government asked the liberia head of state (Charles Taylor) and members of his cabinet to go on exile. During the tenure of Late Francois Massaquoi,(my father) he enriched and accumulated a lot of money while in office but unfortunately for him he did not leave long to enjoy these wealth.

These funds that were lodged in banks accounts in our country has been frozen. However, my family is not too comfortable with our present government as my late father was a very close aide of Charles Taylor, and on this backdrop the new government might decided to recall the frozen money back to the government purse, with exception of the US$8.5M(Eight million, five hundred United State Dollars)that was deposited in a Finance/security firm undiscovered uptil date. But due to the sanction place on my family by the International community i cannot reach this money myself or withdraw it back to Liberia for use.

We have jointly decided within the family to relocate this funds outside Liberia for investment purpose. This is the only way and means we can utilize this money, consequently, we beg for your assistance in investing this money on real-estate and any other viable venture you might suggest. I got your contact through the internet during my search for a partner and i hope you will not disappoint us in this our time of need. We have also agreed to reward you with 25% of the total amount as your share in this transaction after you might have claim this funds from the security firm.

Finally, i require the following informations to facilitate the documentation that will effect the change of ownership with the Finance firm.
  (a) Your complete names.
  (b) Your mailing address and nationality,
  (c) Your Telephone/Fax numbers.
Again, all arrangement and logistics of this transaction are in place and we shall remain greatful if you can assist us in this our time of need.

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.
Thanking you in anticipations of your kindness while looking forward to hear from you soon.
Best regards,

MR.PATRICK MASSAQUOI.

Dear Sir/ Madam,
 
   Before I start, I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you. I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action. I am Mr. Mark Zuba, a native of South Africa currently residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands for a management course, at the Hoge University. 
 Allow me to explain my reason and importance of my writing to you. Sir I am requesting your assistance in order to redeem an investment made with the Southern Mining Corporations Limited, in which I am a senior executive.  The said investment now valued at Ten Million United States of American Dollars (U.S.$10,000.000.00) was purchased by Eric Reilly and contracted out to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited in September 1979.  This redeemable investment interest has now matured and has been cleared for disbursement since March of 2001. 
   Since then, there has been an extensive global wide attempt to locate and notify any living relatives of Eric Reilly being that he himself died in December 1987.  We have confirmed through three independent search agencies that there are no living relatives in which whose favour the investment can be paid.  Being that two of my colleagues are also executives in the account department of the Mining Corporation, we have access to all Reilly's information, we can claim this money with you.  All we need to do is file this claim in your identity and effecting the necessary documentary changes, which lies in our respective departments and proclaim you as actual beneficiary of this investment. 
 These funds can be paid into any designated account in which you provide in any given country.  My proposal to you is that for your assistance you will withhold 30% of the total sum while, ensuring that my partners and I receive the remaining 70%. 
 I hope that you are able to understand the entire nature of my proposal. There is no risk involved in this transaction now or after the successful conclusion of it. As stated earlier, there are no living relatives to lay claims on these funds. Therefore this transaction is legal, however without your assistance this money will be returned over to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited as lost fund. 
 Please for further question, feel free to contact me through this e-mail address: markzub@mail2world.com let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. 
Best regards, 
Mark Zuba

1,"FROM: Judith Hatch

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Mr. Kazeem Hatch who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $12.6Million (Twelve Million six hundred thousand US Dollars) with one Finance/ Security Company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use these fund to fund churches, orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
 
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where i am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the lord, Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on email: judithhatch@dcemail.com  I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company.

I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this aim purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated therein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,

1,"From: Mr. Charles Nwodo
Universal Trust Bank.website:www.utbplc.com
Dear friend,
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it.
 I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that
 I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment. 
 I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself.
 Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
 National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five 
Hundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died 
in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank
 Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government
 if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into
 the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the 
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer
 of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this
 transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com. 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your
 country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address .Thanks and regards. 
Mr. Charles Nwodo.

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the
truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight
of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of Gods
mercy and glory upon my life.
I am Mrs Melissa Pointer the wife of Mr Harry Pointer, my husband
worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died
in the year 2001.We were married for ten years without a child.
My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.
Before his death we were both born again Christians.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.
Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management just
wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of
this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to
receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk
and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is
my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any
where in the World.
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge
responsibility to any of them.
Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand
and collect the Funds from the Bank.
I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund
churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to
ensure that the house of God is maintained.
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want
my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of
death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in
the bosom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold
my peace.
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard
because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's relatives

Cotonou, 
Attn my friend ,  
I am Mr kojo Adams, Auditor, with Accounting
Department,Ecobank here in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I got your
very good name and e-mail address from the online classified
posted on the net.I have decided to contact  you purely on the
personal conviction of trust andconfidence that we can co-operate with one another and do a very
lucrative business for our mutual benefit.The Business I am
proposing to you is in respect of the  sum of US$11,183,000.00
(Eleven Million One Hundred and Eighty-Three  Thousand United
States Dollars Only) deposited in Dollar account with my bank which belonged to Mr Mohamed Saleh
Ibrahim who died on 25th July,2000 in a plane crash, is an Engineering contractor.My bank has made several efforts at 
contacting the family of Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim or his relatives, but all have proved abortive as
he had no identifiable kins men. This sum of US$11.183M has remained unclaimed ever since then and nobody has 
come 
forward as his next of kin. The management under the influence of our chairman and member of the board of directors 
has  
made an arrangement for the fund to be declared unclaimable  and subsequently be turned to the
reserve account of the bank. It is against the background of the  foregoing,that two of my  colleagues and myself in the 
bank 
have decided to contact you for assistance and partnership, for you to stand as
the next of kin to Mr  Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim.

With your permission this fund will be transferred to your private account
abroad as the beneficiary and next of kin to Mr Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim . All proof of claim and necessary 
documentation will be
carefully worked out in your favour and we assure  you of 100% risk free involvement and protection. 
consequently, if you find this proposal acceptable to you and you wish  to assist us, I expect your urgent response and

receipt of that,we shall discuss and agree on the disbursement and sharing ratio.Let me therefore expect your very

1,"ATTENTION
I am Executive Accountant with the south Africa Department of Mining and
Natural Resources (DMNR)South Africa and my department is directly in charge
of contract award and payment of contractors.
In the course of carrying out my duties as contract award/payment
director I negotiated the award of a project to a Swedish firm for US$15
Million and already my government has allocated the amount of US$25 Million
for this particular project.
Having used my position to manipulate the extra US$10 M [ten million
US Dollars] to my favour , I am soliciting a reliable but obscure
individual to assist me as I will be handicap without a foreign partner
given the fact that as a serving civil servant in my country we are not
allowed to operate foreign accounts.
My government is presently paying foreign contractors through their
payment outlet abroad ""Foreign Payment Board"" in London-UK and
if we move fast your particulars can be drafted as one of the contractors to
be paid for onward release of the US$10Million to you/your company via FPB.
I am soliciting that I facilitate the transfer of this money into your
provided account so that I can travel to meet with you after the
transaction to discuss my personal investment plans in your country.
Note clearly that this transaction has been well planned having
followed all the required official contract award/ payment procedures.
Please, You have to give me your total co-operation and follow my advice
/instructions and you should consider this transaction as already successful
& concluded.
Upon your reply I plan to register your company as a contractor with my
Department here in South Africa. for this I would require you to provide me
with your company name, address as well as your phone and fax numbers.
Note clearly that as top Government officials in South Africa, occupying
very sensitive top Government position we receive little salaries compared
to our positions hence I must do this in order to leave a legacy for my

Block 4 Federal Secretariat Road,
Ikoyi-Lagos


REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, the chairman of contract award and review committee set
up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts
executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of
these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of
USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars).

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that
the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid
and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I
are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent
disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of
conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign
accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10%
shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit
the balance
to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of
finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the
funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above
stated terms.

our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction
the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name
or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary.
Once more I want you to understand that
having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I
am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore
be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.

Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a fax
on my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) or mail to private email
address,so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.

I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal
strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we
intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute
the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.

Thanks and God bless,

Dr.Kunle Owolo.

Mr. Jun Cheng,
Bank Of Korea,
16-1, Yoido-dong, 
Youngdungpo-gu, 
Seoul 150-873.

Dear Friend
         I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1998, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.
          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.
            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2005, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.
          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.
Personal Regards,
Mr. Jun Cheng

Attn: Sir/Madam,

{HIGHLY 
CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS)
RE: TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 
MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR
ACCOUNT.
My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I 
work in the International Operation
Department in a Bank here in London.
I feel quite safe dealing with you
in this important business.Though, 
this medium (Internet) has been
greatly abused, I choose to reach you 
through it because it still
remains the fastest medium of 
communication. However, this
correspondence is unofficial and private, 
and it should be treated as
such. 

At first I will like to assure you 
that this transaction is 100% risk
and trouble free to both parties. WE 
WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM
OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR 
TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE
OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, 
a program leader.Until his
death,The Late Prime
Minister, Mr. Rafik 
Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United
Kingdom and all over 
the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum
of(THIRTY SIX MILLION 
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS
STERLINGS) in his account 
here in London which he deposited as a
family valuables.The family do 
not know about this deposit.I was on a
routine inspection that I 
discovered a dormant domiciliary account
with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE
THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on 
further discreet investigation, I also
discovered that the account 
holder has passed away (dead) leaving no
beneficiary to the account. 
The bank will approve this money to any
foreigner because the former 
operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am
certainly sure that nobody 
will come again for the claim of this
money. A foreigner can only claim 
this money with legal claims to the
account Holder, 

Therefore I need 
your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide
all necessary 
information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping
in God that you 
will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik
Bahaa Edine Hariri 
(November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to
Nazek Audi Hariri, 
was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business
tycoon, and was five 
times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and
2000-2004) before his 
last resignation from office on October 20,
2004. The late Rafik Hariri 
died on February 14, 2005 when explosives
equivalent to around 300 kg 
of C4 were detonated as his motorcade
drove past the Saint George Hotel 
in the Lebanese capital, for more
information please log on to (http:
//www.hariri.info/)

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW 
THAT THIS
MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW 
OURSELVES
BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I 
CONTACT
YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES 
INTO
YOUR ACCOUNT.

I am Mark james, the only Son of late Mr and Mrs James. My father was a very 
wealthy cocoa Farmer and cocoa merchant before he was killed to death by his 
pollitical associates on one of their outing to make pollitical dialoug. 
When my mother died on the 21st October 1994, my father took me and my 
younger sister special because we are motherless.

Before the death of my father on 2nd Feb 2004 in a private hospital He 
secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of $10.5m 
(Ten Million, five hundred thousand dollars) left in a suspense account in
a local Bank in Abidjan, the capital of cote d ivorie that he used my name 
as his ONLY Son for the next of kin in deposit of the fund.

He also explained to me that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner 
in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use
it for investment purpose, (such as real estate management).  Sir, we are 
honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.

1) To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to.
2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am a smail boy Moreover Sir,
we are willing to offer you 20% of the sum as compensation for effort input
after the successful transfer of this fund to your designate account

1,"  Attn,
  Greeting, 
I solicit your confidence in this transaction that I propose to you. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. 
Your discreteness and ability to handle a transaction of this nature is of the uttermost importance. 
  Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.My name is  Mr Mike Charles Kobi, I'm the Son of late COL. JOHNSON KOBI (The assistant chief of general staff of sierra Leone�s revolutionary united front R.U.F) and at the crown Prince of kuloma village in the south � west district of sierra Leone; who died on the 29th of august 2000 with some of his colleagues during the war in my Country.

  I came to know of you in my �private� search on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In brief, I have the sum of Nine million, two hundred thousands US dollars (9,200,000:00 U.S. dollars). This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company here in Dakar - Senegal, of which I was made the sole beneficiary along side with my aged mother. 
Because of the present situation in my country sierra Leone, I decided to leave the country immediately because of some security reasons and also to look for a trust worthy and reliable person(s) who can assist us to transfer this money out of Dakar Senegal based on the agreement that was signed by my late father and the security company before his death. 
As a Young Man, I pray that you being a kind hearted person(s) will surely help me to transfer this money to your country and also to assist in investing it in a profitable business which will yield more money.  I feel that I can confide in you , hoping that you will not betray me. 
  I have proposed twenty per cent (30%) of this money to you, so as for you to give all necessary assistance and protections we need in your country, 60% for us and 10% for the expenses which both will incurred as a result of this transaction. 
  Please treat as highly confidential because our future depends  on this money being the only thing that we have after running away from our country. 
  All the vital documents covering this deposit in the security company are with me here in Dakar Senegal and will be faxed to you on demand after I certify that you are worthy to do business with. The reason I searched for you importantly is because, based on the agreement made by my late father and the security company that simply stipulates that in case of his death, his money should be transferred out of Africa. 
   I would like to secure my money in your care as I have decided to order a command to the security company to transfer the money to you depending on your urgent reply to my request and my assessment of your person. Note that this transaction demands the highest trust and confidence between the two of us. Moreover, it is risk free in the sense that I have taken proper care of all formalities regarding this transaction. 
If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me Mike Charles Kobi by writing to the above mail address.You can reach me with my aternative mail at(macdani500@hotmail.com) You will have to send your most confidential Telephone/Fax numbers so that I can relay confidential information - as they will come in directly to you. 
Thanking you in advance for your anticipated cooperation. 
Expecting a reply. 
Thank you. God Bless. 
Yours Faithfully, 
Mike Charles Kobi.

Nigerian National Petroleum Company
Contract Awarding Committee
Member: Executive Council. 

Dear Friend,

REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE 

I am James Abure, I know this 
letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne out of my sincere 
desire to share a mutual business relationship with you. First, your 
strictest confidence in this transaction is highlt solicited. 

This is 
by virtue of its nature as being confidential and top secret. 
I am a 
government official with a statutory corporation and a member of an 
adhoc committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review 
contracts awarded by past administration. In the course of identifying, 
scrutinizing and recommending payment for all valid contracts executed, 
we discovered a huge sum of money amounting to US$ 75.5 million 
(Seventy-five million five hundred thousand dollars) on grossly over-
invoiced contract already awarded and executed for the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation. 

Having cleaned the Augean Stable, we 
intend to transfer the balance of US$ 75.5 million presently floating 
in our Apex Bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and advantage. However 
we ask for your unwavering assistance in this regard because as civil 
servants we are prohibited under the civil service code of conduct from 
operating a foriegn account or running a foreign company unless after 
retirement. In this vain we want you to front for us as a partner to 
enable us lodge the funds speedily into your account. 

Bear in mind 
that no risk is attached to this project and all logistics are in place 
and modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated 
time. This is in accordance with the fact that you must never betray 
the trust already reposed on you. We have decided to compensate you 
with 30% of the total sum for your support, 60% for us, while 10% is 
mapped out for miscellaneous expenses ( local and international). 

Please if interested, provide your confidential phone and fax number to 
enable me contact you for further discussion on this matter. Please 
advise in your return mail, which time is confidential enough to call 
you. And also call me if you are interested in the proposal with this 
number - 234 8 

Looking forward to hear from you. 

Best Regards, 
James Abure.

country as a banker,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and 
would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer 
because I workin this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a 
second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the 
bank and also present a foreign account where hewill need the money to be 
re-transfered ,into on his requestas it may be, after due verification and 
clarification by bank officails.

total sum as gratification,while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while the remaining 60%

1,"FROM THE DESK OF 
DR. HASSAN DIKO
N N P C.
EMAIL: hassandiko@fsmail.net

MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am Dr. HASSAN DIKO,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of
multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:
1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).

2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.
. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.

The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.

It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is
enormous.

In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian officials.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.

Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.

Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.

Send by Email for security reasons.

Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.
Very truly yours,
Dr. HASSAN DIKO
PLEASE NOTE:Send your reply to my confidencial email addres(hassandiko@hknetmail.com)

economic planning here in Banjul, Gambia, west .Africa my department the 
treasury department does transactions that run into several hundresds of 
millions of dollars quaterly. Myself and two other colleagues in this

cleared for payment. However by virtue of our positions as civil 
servants in our country we cannot acquire this money directly, in our names. 
We are not allowed by the civil service code of conduct to own or 
operate bank account outside our shores, on the other hand it is not safe for

I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for 
an overseas silent partner in whose account we would transfer the 
us$18,500,000.00 to, for our mutual benefit, hence the reason for this 
email. I am requesting that you assist us as our silent partner and receive 
the funds in your account for us on trust. We propose to share as 
follows, 20% to you as commision and 80 for us. You will be free to take

possibilities your country. Should it not be convenient for you to assist with 
investing, we can end our cooperation after you hand over to our 
percentage of the money. The transaction although discrete is legitimate, the 
money will be transferred to your account with all necessary back-up 
documents showing legitimacy and source origin of funds. The transfer 
will be effected within seven working days to be completd. I plead with 
you on one issue, whether you are interested or not please do not

In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  
  
The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. 
  
The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand
as next of kin to a foreigner. 
  
In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. 
  
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email for further directives. 
  
Yours Faithfully, 
Mr. John Taylor."

Attn:President/Ceo.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.  This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.  I got your contact in my private search  for a reliable person to handle this  transaction. We shall base this transaction on mutual respect and honesty. Hence,it is neccessary for you to assure us of your ability  to prosecute this transaction of  great magnitude,your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence.

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria.  In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said trapped funds.

The source of this fund is as follows:  During the past Military Regimes here in Nigeria, the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contract which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries.  As a result the Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo deemed it neccessary to set up a Contract Review Panel to investigate and recommend accordingly. After a thorough investigation, we discovered a lot of  inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria.. We (members) have unanimously agreed to transfer part of these funds to a foreign account  However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of this Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the Panel to look for an Overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty One Million, Five Hundred Thousand US. Dollars).  Adequate logistics and
strategies had been worked out to ensure a successful transfer with your maximum  co-operation. Hence we are writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money thus:

1.    25% for the account owner (you)
2.    70% for us (the officials)
3.    5% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business, please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope to commence and conclude the transfer latest in ten (10) banking days from the date of receipt a reply from you indicating your willingness to assist.
The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. Moreso, we will use your name or company's name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name or company's name.  We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your confidentiality in this transaction.  Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the this mail box .  
I will bring you into the complete picture of this lucrative project when I have heard from you.

Yours Faithfully,


Sincerely yours, 

Regards,

Wilson Ajala.

Equity Chambers
Lagos, Nigeria.
 
Attention:
 
Greetings to you.
 
I am Mr. Willam David  Nelson, Principal Partner Benson & Associates (EQUITY
CHAMBERS).I need your urgent and very confidential approach to this proposition.
 
On April 12 2000, my client a ForeignOilConsultant/Contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. James Nartaev made a numbered
time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,000,000.00
(Twelve Million United States Dollars).
 
Upon maturity of his deposit, the chambers got a routine notification from
the Finance House which was sent to his forwarding address. After a month,
we got a reminder from the Finance House and I had to verify his whereabout
from his contract employers, the NNPC.
 
Unfortunately, I was informed by the NNPC that my client died from an automobile
accident about a month to the first letter froim the Finance House. As his
legal representative, I know that my client died without making a WILL,and
all my attempts to trace his next of kin has been fruitless.
 
Furthermore, as his attorney, I am aware that he did not declare any next
of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Depository
Form with the Finance House.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration
of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives, I seek your
consent to present you as the next of kin of my late client so that the
proceeds of this account valued at 12 million dollars (minus incurred interest)can
be paid to you. I will expect you to use your human discretion in sharing
the funds when it's been transferred into your custody.
 
I will put together all necessary legal documents that can be used to back
up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this deal through particularly your words of honor not to sit on
the funds when it's in your control.
 
 Please! I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with
me by my email and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us
discuss furtherabout this transaction.
 
I wait to hear from you soon. Have a nice day.Thank you.

Dear President/Ceo.

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from South Africa.

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.

I am Mr.Larry Edwards,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the account died without a Heir apparent to the throne hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account who is Mr.Gregory A.Williams,a foreigner and an industrialist died, since 1990,until now no other person(s) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account. As such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr.Gregory A.Williams until his death was the manager Diamond Safari Company,in South Africa.

However, if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with Forty Two Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.

While the total amount involved is One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00)only.I would want us to make a first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe Foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account, without valid international foreign Agreement, but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the former owner of the account Mr.Gregory A.Williams is a foreigner too,thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account.

However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding agreement in this regards.

As a matter of urgency, I will inform you the next step to take, while you Send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments,I need your full co-operation to make this business a success,because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you,upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down.

With my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.And to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. 

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act as directed. 

To prove the authenticity of the business I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries,foreign exchange departments, embassy and Board of Internal Revenue Services.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount,60% will be for me,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process.

I look forward to your earliest reply throughmy email address:S_ed@consultant.com.

Yours,

Mr.Larry Edwards.

* Money orders or drafts( this forms of payment have been put on hold due to
some security reasons)

ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO.

I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for
you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid
Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million
Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid
Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska
Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person,
you can contact this website:
http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace
his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and
discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my
Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We
shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of
the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in
any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may
incur during transactions.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me
your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And
kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

My private Phone +27-73-400-4485 or Fax +27-11-507-5946.  I wait for your
quick response.

Kindest regards,

ALBERT SITHOLI.

2007 and therefore,he has a certain amount of USD$300,000.000.00(Three hundred million dollars) which he wants to invest overseas with a reliable foreign partners,hence I am contacting you.

As a matter of fact,I have already told Mr.President that I knew someone in oversea, a business mogul whom I trusted and believed that could handle these arrangement successfully. Though,His excellency is looking at the area of setting up a private oil refinery or Real Estate,but that does not mean that any other viable and lucrative business is a bad idea.

If you are interested and capable of handling this arrangement please,kindly write and indicate your capability and furnish me with your present line of business.

Let me also know your country of origin and your proposed country of the said investment. More details would be given to you upon my receipt of your urgent response.

Please send your response only to this email address as stated here :emmaokaforr@k.ro

Sincerely,

Hon.Barrister Emmanuel Okafor.

UNITED KINGDOM.

I have access to an amount in excess of US$6.5 M, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 30% of the total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?

I am Mrs. ERRY HERYATI (an Indonesian by birth), I am the personal secretary to Mr. Alexei Pichugin who was the former security Chief of YUKOS OIL company of Russia (Russian Most Largest Oil Company), but unfortunately he was charged on fake charges and has just been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for murder he did not commit and is still facing new charges in Russia. Until recently I was living in Moscow, but had to relocate and go into exile in London where I am currently recovering from the injuries inflicted on me during the raiding of our offices in Moscow and  Samara, Penza, Voronezh, Orel, Bryansk, Tambov, Lipetsk, and Ulyanovsk Regions of Central Russia. Since the Russian government's attacks  started on our company - Yukos Oil Co., my life has been thrown into severe mystery, I lost all I had, and today, I am in a secret private home recovering from very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to talk and to hear clearly based on the severe torture I underwent in the hands of agents of state.

The document of the above funds in question was handed over to me by Mr. Alexei Pichugin to be used in payment for his last oil deal with Yukos Oil Co. Already the funds have been deposited with a prime Bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on this process, my boss, Mr. Alexei Pichugin got arrested for his involvement in politics which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president. 

All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will present to you the documentation which will enable this prime Bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use my share of this funds to invest and relocate to your country so we need to conclude in the shortest possible time.

You can only reach me through this dedicated fax number in South London where I am hiding in exile as all phones calls to the residence where I am are bugged and been monitored, the fax number is: +447092025297 or email address- erry@heryati.com, I will not be able to speak with you on phone for now as I found it difficult to speak, but you can always drop a voice message on this number and I will get back to you either by fax or email. As soon as I get your willingness to cooperate with me I shall give you more details.

Thank you very much and God bless you.

1,"DEAR RESPECTFUL ONE, 
I AM MISS ALICIA MADOUH  FROM THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE IN WEST AFRICA. 

  I AM THE ONLY CHILD OF MR MADOUH AND MRS LINDA MADOUH (MY MOTHER). MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER WERE DIAMOND MERCHANT FOR SO MANY YEARS BEFORE THE POLITICAL CRISES BEGAN IN MY COUNTRY, SIERRA LEONE. OUR RESIDENCE WAS MERCILESSLY ATTACKED AND LOOTED. 
   
  MY MOTHER WAS RAPPED AND BUTCHERED TO DEATH ON THAT UNFAITHFUL DAY. MY FATHER WENT DEEP HIDDEN WITH ME. AFTER SOME DAYS, MY FATHER ARRANGED WITH SOME LOYAL FORCES AND THEY LED US TO LIBERIA AND FROM THERE WE PAID OUR WAY TO LIBERIA-IVORY COAST BORDER CALLED ""DANANE"". 

  THEREAFTER WE WERE RECEIVED BY THE UNITED NATION OFFICIALS ON SPECIAL DUTIES FOR REFUGEES AND WE WERE ACCOMODATED. WE LATER ARRIVE ""BOUAKE"" THE LARGEST CITY IN THE IVORY COAST. 
   
  I WAS LEAVING WITH MY FATHER COMFORTABLY UNTIL THE POLITICAL CRISES OF THIS COUNTRY BEGAN ON THE 19TH OF SEPTEMEBER 2002. AND BOUAKE WAS CAPTURED BY THE REBELS WITH SHOOTING, KILLING, RAPPING AND LOOTINGS GOIN ON VERY FAST. AT THESE EVIL EVENTS, MY FATHER BEGAN TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN MY COUNTRY SIERRA LEONE AND HE COULD NOT HOLD UP HIMSELF. HE FINALLY HAD A HEART BREAK AND WAS RUSHED TO THE NEAREST MILITARY HOSPITAL FOR URGENT THREATMENT. 
   
  BUT THAT SAME HOSPITAL WAS ATTACKED AFTER FEW HOURS OF OUR ARRIVAL AND MY FATHER SEIZED TO BREATH DUE TO HEART FAILURE. FROM THERE, I BECAME LONELY AND A FULL ORPHAN WITHOUT ANY ONE TO CONSOLE ME EXCEPT FRIENDS AND CLOSE NEIGHBOURS. 
   
  I RAN TO ABIDJAN AS THE WAR INCREASED WITH THE HELP OF SOME MILITARY MEN THROUGH BUSH. I AM NOW IN ABIDJAN SINCE THE YEAR 2003 AND HAVE BEEN ACCOMODATED BY CHRISTIAN FAMILY. HOPING THAT ONE DAY VERY SOON THERE WILL BE PEACE BUT ALL TO NO AVAIL. I AM NOW AT A STATE OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT. I CAN NOT CONTINUE MY EDUCATION WITH THIS SITUATION. I HAVE NO FAMILY AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT. 
   
  I HAVE DECIDED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER ASKING FOR YOUR GOD TOUCHED WILLINGNESS AND MERCY TO HELP ME TO RELOCATE FROM HERE TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO HELP ME CONTINUE MY EDUCATION AND MOST ESPECIALLY TO SEE AND ACCEPT ME AS YOUR FAMILY MEMBER.
   
   I AM AFRAID ABOUT A HUGE  AMOUNT OF MONEY  LEFT WITH A BANK BY MY FATHER UNDER A SUSPENSE MONEY ACCOUNT; AND I HAVE INQUIRED ABOUT THAT AND GOT A FULL CONFIRMATION OF THAT DIRECTLY FROM THE BANK. 
   
  I HAVE REQUESTED TO CLAIM THE MONEY BUT THE PROCESSES ARE TOO HEAVEY FOR ME TO FOLLOW UP. LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL CRISES; I AM TOO AFRAID TO MENTION IT TO ANY BODY AROUND ME AS MOST PEOPLE HAVE BECOME TRAITORS AND REBELS. SOME ARE ALSO SEARCHING FOR OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS TO GO AWAY WITH FROM THIS WAR ZONE COUNTRY ............... 
   
  I  WISH TO RELEASE AND TRANSFER THAT SUM TO ABROAD UNDER YOUR CARE TO ENABLE ME FURTHER MY EDUCATION AND LIVE A BETTER LIFE ALL THRU YOUR GOOD MANAGEMENT OF THE MONEY IN A FRUITFUL BUSINESS THAT YOU KNOWS BEST.

Dear.Sir

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. 
My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.
This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.
And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  
I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. 

Best regards,

Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

    FROM MR.PETER DANIEL
DIRECTOR INCHARGE OF

UNIT,AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
PHONE NUMBER:  00229 95 81 42 10
PRIVATE EMAIL: peterdanielx4@hotmail.com

Dear Friend ,

In a brief introduction, I am Peter Daniel, the Director of Operation  with     AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) of Benin-Cotonou ,Republic of Benin.I have a very interesting transaction to discuss with you. The business  underdiscussion has to do with one of our customer a national of your
country, who is a Consultant/ contractor with Societe Nationale Des  Products D' Agricole (SONAPRA) Company in Benin-Cotonou. I managed to get your  contact details through the Internet search  myself because time is of     importance to it and I am desperately looking for Someone to assist me to pull this money out from the bank before our   corrupt government
officials will confiscate the money.

On Thursday, December 25, 2003, this our customer , his wife and their  only daughter were involved in Air-Crash near the Atlantic Ocean in Cotonou  suburb. For more clarifications, you can visit the CNN web news for the  tragedy.
www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash

Since then I have made several inquiries to your Embassy, in a bid to locate any relation of this our customer. All attempts to reach the  next of  kin of our customer has been futile as He had no family here in Benin Republic.Hence my decision to contact you. I want you and I to go into
partnership, the nature of your business is completely irrelevant to this transaction as all I need from you is an assurance that my  interest will be fully protected once this transaction is concluded.

He made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for twelve calendar Months  and his account with our Bank accrues to about (Fourteen Million, Three  hundred and Fifty- Two Thousand US Dollars) $USD14.352M.

According to the Benin Law, at the expiration of (Three) years, the  money will revert to the ownership of the Benin government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to our customer so that the
fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt  government officials who will latter use the money to sponsor war in Africa and  kill innocent citizens in the search for political power/seat. Please note  that There will be no problem at all, my position as the Director of
Operation guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction within 7 Banking days and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me.
This is very simple, I will like you to reply immediately so that I can send you the Text of application which you will fill and apply to the bank as the next of kin to our customer and I will use my good position in the bank as the Director of Operation to make sure that the application is approved,
during board meeting for immediate payment. If you are   interested, reply 
immediately via my private email address: peterdanielx4@hotmail.com

So that we can proceed at once. Please send to me also your private  phone,  or mobile numbers for easier correspondence.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best Regards.

1,"Dear Sir,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that
this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat
it serious. I am Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan, a banker
with the GuarantY Trust Bank Nigeria Plc.  I am the
Accounts officer of late Mr. Robert Chapman the
African Area Director of SIL International, who
unfortunately died in the crash of Kenya Airways
Flight 431 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, January 30 2000.

Mr. Chapman was from Hamilton, Ontario Canada.

Since the death of Chapman, I as his accounts officer
in the bank, have made several enquiries to locate his
only surviving relation, without any success. I came
across your name and contact, on the course of my
personal searching for Chapman's relations, so I
decided to contact you for this project.

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating and
securing the wealth left behind in a fixed deposit
account by Robert, before they get confiscated or
declared unserviceable by my bank. The board of my
bank, has issued a notice that after 2 months from now
and no next of kin shown up for the claim, the funds
will be confiscated and declared unserviceable. Since
I and my team have been unsuccessful in locating
Robert's relatives for sometime now, I seek your
consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the
deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the
proceed of this deposit valued at Seven million five hundred thousand 
dollars can be released to you.
The bank will release the funds to any foreigner who
has all related information/documents to the bank
account. I am in charge of this matter in my bank,
because I am his accounts officer. Your application
will be directed to my department for verification and
approval. Everything is under my control.   

I shall provide you all the information and copy of
the certificate of deposit issued to Robert when he
deposited the funds. I shall also involve a good
attorney who shall represent you in all the
appropriate offices for the claim. Please, find in the
attachment my work ID Card. This is just to proof to
you that my proposal is genuine. I also have all
necessary information we need for the claim and once
the money is transferred to you, I shall destroy all
the documents used for the claim and leave no traces.
After everything, you shall have Fourty percent of the total
sum,while sixty percent for me.


All requires is your honest cooperation to enable us
see this business successful. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law. Robert
was a very good man and it is not wise to allow his
hard earned wealth to be stolen by the greedy
directors of my bank.

Further details awaits your response by email. PLEASE,
TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET. Please, confirm the
receipt of my Id Card in the attachment, as it was
difficult to attach.

Best Regards

Muhammad Khalil Hasan.
Banker.

1,"Dear Sir/Madam, 
compliments of the day. i got your email address from the south African on 
line network without wasting your time let me go straight to the point. 

In my department we discovered sum of $20million Us 
dollars(Twenty-million Us dollars) in an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customers Late MR.THOMPSON MORRIS Age 61 an American who 
unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines 
Flight261 which crashed on January- 31- 2000, including his wife and only 
daughter. Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting 
his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we 
cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation 
to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 

Unfortunately I learned that his supposed next of kin being his only 
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the 
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to 
make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin 
or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement 
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into 
Government treasury asunclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here 
stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be 
transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed funds. 

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. I will visit your country 
for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this 
money gets into your account. Please be honest to me. Note this transaction 
is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this email you should 
contact me through my e-mail address. 
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of 
these funds to you as has been finalized. 

HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON.

Federal Ministry of works and housing
Federal secretariat office complex
Garki,Abuja,
Nigeria. 
ATTN: Dear Friend,
Request for assistance: Strictly Confidential 

I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H 

Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee 

set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present 

civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review 

existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and 

reputable person to handle a very confidential 

transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of 

money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of 

ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of 

the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The 

original value of these contracts were delibrately over 

invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6,000,000.00 (Nine million six 

hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been 

approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the 

companies that actually executed these contracts have been 

fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the 

total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, 

since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of 

conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or 

opening foreign accounts in our names. 
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is 

enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 

transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental 

expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the 

course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the

Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment since I am also interested in buying a residential property as I will be moving my family over there as soon as every thing regarding technical and logistics details is worked out and ascertained to our respective satisfaction. 

In view of your participation, we are ready to give you a good will have to negotiable percentage for your assistance , or better still commit it into viable Joint venture projects. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me and my only survived son. 

As soon as I get your consent, we will quickly move the fund to your country for investment, this will come after our meeting which will be held between you and us to enable us know each other and seal an agreements to protect the fund and each others interest which will foster the much needed trust, reliability and understanding which is paramount in business relationship. 

I am here in Thailand with my only surviving Son Musa. I am strongly believe that you would be of great help in guiding us to a sucessful exploration of the investment potentials of your country , which guarantees good capital returns and human security. 

Lastly, I honestly pray and believe that this money when its finally moved to your country will be used for the said purpose of investing in profitable project. However, upon your acceptance to work as my partner, you can contact us with our private telephone number or e-mail for more details.

1,"Dear Friend
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. 
I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in 
good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the 
CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at 
US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was 
moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on 
the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to 
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. 

On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he 
did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any 
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no 
one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not 
aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.
With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. 
By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of 
above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country 
immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money. 
I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to 

late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of 
the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. 

All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under 
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are 
interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. 
I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: arahkhrahman@yahoo.com.au

Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.   "

PROPOSITION;
I discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of
an automobile crash. He actually deposited this funds amounting to
US$40,000,000.00 (fourty million united states dollars), for safe
keeping in my company here in Nigeria. Company file records shows that the 
funds was actually for a project. Our late costurmer wanted to start a multi 
million Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA in the near futur,before his 
sudden and untimely death. As such since his death none ofhis relations or 
next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this property as the heir, 
this basically the reason why I have
contacted you. My company cannot release the property unless someone
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our 
operating guidelines.
Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully
worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the
beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that I have
secured from the probate an order to locate any of deceased
beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance

you can personally appear for the claim. I shall be compensating you
with 30% of the total money while 10% will be for any expenses incurred and 
the rest will be mine on final conclusion of this project. Please note that 
your share stays while the rest shall be for me for investment purposes.

           Urgent!
Attention:
Do not be surprised about this letter to you as I got
your contact through a financial consultant of mine in Europe. My name is 
Gooday
Nkomo the last born of late Joshua Nkomo the former
Vice President of Zimbabwe and Former President of
Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). However, I was
studying in a boarding high school when I had to
forcefully return for my father's burial. After the
burial, my father's lawyer notified the family about
his Will in their chamber. While going through the
will, I discovered that my father used his position as
the Former Vice President to acquire and make a
deposition of US$ 23 M {Twenty-three Million United
States dollars} in a special Security Company in South
Africa.

I immediately had to travel to South Africa where a
financial Expert advised me on the best way to safe
guard and realize usefully this funds without any
problems from the South African authorities. This was
to involve a foreigner, who will come down here to
South Africa, open a non-resident Bank account where
the money will be deposited for onward transfer to any
nominated account overseas as foreigners are highly
respected.
This is why I am making this contact with you now
though I am in Amsterdam arranging for the best
possible way to ensure the delivery of the consignment
to Europe here. You are to come down to Amsterdam and
assist me in getting the money out to your beautiful
country where I and my family can make further
investment of the money and where I can live a better
life and have a better education as this is my life
long dream. Here in Amsterdam, my refugee status has
eliminated any chances of my owning an account.
Please, do contact me with my Tel No: +873-76 3432240
or Fax No: +873 76 3432241 or Amsterdam
Tel:+31indicating your interest and capability for more
details. You are entitled to 25% of the total amount
for assisting me; I have mapped out 3% for immediate
re-imbursement for expenses upon your arrival here,
while the rest will be for me, and my family members,
which I would like to invest in your country under your
close supervision and direction. Note: The content of
the consignment is US$ 23 million cash money, but the
Security Company does not know the actual content of
the consignment because it was deposited by my father
with a declaration that the content is precious metals
and diamond valued at US$ 23 M, and this was done with
diplomatic immunity and for security reason, at the
time, my father was still in government in my country
Zimbabwe.
This transaction is basically risk-free for you;
therefore, reach me, preferably with the above stated
phone or fax number to ensure the security of this
transaction. Note that it is because of the
confidential nature of this transaction that I am
giving you these contact info. which you can use to

COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC.

E-MAIL BOX:barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca



My name is Mr.JAMES BROWN. I am the credit AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING

UNIT,BANK OF AFRICA,COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC. I am contacting you of a business


transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know

that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and

worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off,

and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you

due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION; I am the account officer  of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh

who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999

in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can

confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD

NEWS.


WEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his

death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money

as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his

wife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his

account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the

deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.


Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a

next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully

worked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in

your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the

money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and

the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. 


so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to

share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.

It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an

order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please

acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual

business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are

interested.


1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for

transfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax

numbers. For  our personal contact and mutual trust in each other.

I shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars)

on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the

balance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes.

Because I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me

immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed

in you, I await your urgent reply. to this address: barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca

I am the surviving Daughter of  Dr. and Mrs Hatleberg who died as a result of plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000. My family converted to Islam in 1998. When my late Parent were alive, my father deposited the sum of$8.5 Million (eight million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with International Diplomatic service firm in south east Asia with purpose to invest the fund in Islamic foundation in Asia before death took him, The fund is still under safe keeping with the International Diplomatic firm in south east Asia, hence am contacting you to help me to achieve this project in your country. Two years ago I fell sick and my doctor told me I had cancer, I had tried all my best to treat myself with every medical expert but there is no improvement, Currently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six months due to my cancer problems. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to mosque, Islamic school authority or better Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I instruct. I want this fund to be disburse to, orphanages, widows promoting the work of Almighty Allah, needies and to promote work of almighty Allah in your country. The Koran made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have anybody left except Almighty Allah and my Father relatives are Christians and unbelievers. I don't want my Father hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers because I know he will be rejoicing in the bosom of Allah if this fund is spent to promote the work of almighty Allah.

Dear, 

By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. 

Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. 

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . 

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to 
understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. 

Trusting to hear from you, I remain 

Respectfully yours, 

Mr. Idris Umar.

Dear ,

I am Mark Nguessane from Seirra-Leone I am the son of Chief Nguessane Bakari 
who was the managing director and owner of NGEBAK Import/Export 
company,NGEBAK Logistics company and NGEBAK Glass company here in Abidjan 
Cote d'Ivoire West Africa.

Dear I humbly wish to write you this letter in order that you will assist me 
and my only Sister Cecilia in this money transfer to your bank account in 
your country for investment in a profitable business.

On the 11th october 2004 our late father attended the general meeting of all 
the import/export companies in the country and unfortunately he was poisoned 
by his business rivals and he later died in the hospital.

But before his death,after staying in bed for three days in the hospital,he 
told me that he deposited the sum of US$12,000,000.(Twelve Million US 
dollars) in a bank here in abidjan on behalf of his foreign business partner 
in abroad and he advised me to look for a co-beneficiary from abroad to 
transfer these money to his account for investment in his country.

Presently,the members of his extended family has claimed all his companies 
leaving nothing behind for us,his extended family members also sent us away 
from his house where we are living and they seized all our house hold 
properties.

We are presently now staying in a hotel here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire 
because of our lives and the security of the valid documents which the bank 
gave to our late father on the day he made the deposit lest the members of 
our late fathers extended family will kill us and Claim these money in the 
bank.

Based on our ignorance in the international business world of this sort,we 
hereby solicit for your urgent assistance as the co-beneficiary of these 
money, for the bank to transfer these money to your safe and secured bank 
account in your country.

for further proceedings as we wait for your soonest response. Please,we 
don't want neither third party nor publicity of any kind in this business 
transaction as we have agreed to offer you 25% of the total sum and 75% will 
be for us respectively as you will also assist us to join you in your 
country as soon as this money is transfered to your account in your country 
for the investment.

Thanks in advance as we wait for your soonest response,

          London, U.K.

          Fax line: +44 709 287 0887
          E-mail:barristertony@compaqnet.fr

I must apologise for berging into your mailbox without a formal introduction 
of myself to you. Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to 
get a good and capable business person in your country for both business and 
investment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am  Barrister 
Frank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson 
an American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost 
his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on 
January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.

You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,

1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list

2. http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his 
family had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it 
was also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's  next of kin was his daughter 
who died with him in the crash.

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the 
expiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. 
GOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the 
next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these 
funds for both of us.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:-

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document 
that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.

PLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW,

[1] NAME:

[2] ADDRESS:

[3] AGE:

[4] SEX:

[5] TELEPHONE:

[6] FAX:

[7] OCCUPATION STATUS:

Also be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to 
accomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been 
made the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your 
behalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in 
your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided 
by you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities 
to see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the 
necessary documents.

Please note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times 
during this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your 
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for 
you and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this 
transaction. If you are not interested, please delete this letter so that I 
can scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction. Should 
you be interested please send me your full names, telephone, fax number and 
email address as stated above.  I will prefer that you reach me via this 
email address:- frankmichelle@compaqnet.fr

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

ATTN:My Dear,

My name is Mr. Michael Ezra. I am the accountant of the International Commercial Bank-Ghana, First Light Branch Accra. I am a Ghanaian married with three kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the noble transfer of US$14,800,000.00 (Fourtheen million, eight hundred thousand U.S.dollars). This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the accountant made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved end of the last year report for the year 2005 to my Head Office here in Accra and they will never know of this Excess.I have since then, placed this amount of US$14,800,000.00 (Fourtheen million, eight hundred thousand U.S. dollars) on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account.

It is going to be a bank-to-bank transfer to your nominated bank account anywhere you feel safer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.

Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it,my yearly income is barely about $3,500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it, so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die.

I am offering you 30% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account, because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim transfer.I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account.I have all the payment claim information worked out. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal Through.

Please i will like you to answer me this questions.
(1)Can a black man build a house in your country and invest there?
(2)Can a black man be given staying permit and be allowed to visit sight seen?
(3)Can i direct any company of my own?

(Executive Manager) 
Private Tel/Fax: 234-1-7598296 
Private E-mail: philjones1@uboot.com 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX 
banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent 
and very confidential 
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an 
American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with 
us and his present balance is valued at 
US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his 
employers that he died from an automobile accident. On 
further investigation, we found out from his account 
file that he never made a will and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. 
We therefore made further investigations and 
discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any 
next of kin or relations in all his official documents 
in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still 
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest 
is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it 
is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this 
money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration 
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you 
to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. 
This is simple; all we need is some of your details so 
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. 
Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services 
of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and 
notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary 
documents and letters of probate/administration in 
your favour for the transfer. The money would be 
shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. 

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this 
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my 
position as a manager guarantees the successful 
execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please reply immediately via email. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest 
assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for us. I shall still require your assistance to 
invest my own share in your country just incase you 
can help, otherwise we'll take our share . 

Awaiting your urgent reply, 

Mr.Philip Jones.

l am Dr.Titi Okonkwo., Civil Servant in the Ministry 
of Health. l know this proposal will come to you as 
asurprise because we have not met before either 
physically or through correspondence. 
I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here
in Nigeria and have no doubt in your ability to handle
this proposal involving huge sum of money. 
My father Chief Isama Okonkwo (Now Late) was the Royal
Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich town) in
Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the total crude
oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value
of each barrel is paid to my father as royalty by the
Federal Government. My father was also the Chairman of
ISAMA Special Oil Trust Fund. In his position as the
Royal head and Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made
some money which he left for me as the only heir to
inherit.
The money is Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand
US Dollars(US$18.5). This Money originated from the
accumulated royalties between 1976-1998 . Due to poor
banking system in Nigeria and political instability as
a result of past Military rules (1985-1999) , he
deposited this Money in a Strong Room/""VAULTS"" with an
open beneficiary in a security company pending when he
would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad . He
was planning this when he died late last year of Heart
Attack. 
Just before my father died he called my attention to
the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who
would assist me in the transfer/investment of the
funds abroad. So l would be very grateful if you could
accept to help me achieve this great objective. 
I promise to give you 15% of the total funds
transferred to your vital bank account as compensation
for your assistance. Five percent (5%)has been set
aside to take care of all expenses we may incure
during the transaction. To indicate your interest,
contact me urgently and confidentially for more
information and the roles you will play in this
business. 
All the legal Documents concerning this Money will be
sent to you as soon as we agreed together. Please I will 
appreciate that you send your telephone/fax numbers to 
enable me contact you immediately for discussions. 
May the almighty God bless you.

1,"FROM THE DESK OF DR DINKA DOGON
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER .
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . BURKINA FASO ANNEX.

I hope this meets you in good health, My name is Dr Dinka Dogon the  manager 
of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of  African 
development bank , Burkina Faso Annex here in Ouagadougou, west  africa.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twenty-two Million United 
  States Dollar US$22m dollars in an account, belonging to one of our 
customer  Eng. Christian Eich ,Who died alongside with his entire family on 
Monday,  31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in paris.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next  
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  
indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and my colleagues decided to make 
  this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank  
treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  
unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the bank  
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  
business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your designated 
bank account ,you must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin 
of the deceased with a text of application that we will send to you, so we  
will like you to send to us your private telephone , fax number  for easy 
and effective communication and location where the money
will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, we will send to you by fax or email the text of  
the application . we will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should
contact us immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours faithfully.
Dr Dinka Dogon
Bill & Exchange Manager,

1,"Dear, 
In my quest for a reliable and reputable person to engage in a mutual business relationship, 
I got your email through my retune search for a suitable preson that can help me in my predicament. And I  sincerely apologies for my contacting you in this form please bear with me.  And accept my indecent introduction, it was bore out of my despiration to get off my inadequcy to takle my immediate problems.
 .
 As a matter of introduction, I am the only surviving daughter of late Chief Ibrahim Sessey Cola, the paramount chief of Munsh District of Sierra Leone who was killed on  8th January  1999, by the trigger happy rebels. Most unfortunately 
for me I came  from a polygamous family, and a student but out of school because of this problem.
During my father's lifetime he was actively engaged in ILLEGAL MINING AND SALES OF 
DIAMOND, from where he made his enormous wealth. 
Prior to my father's death, he left a WILL with his lawyer, which was made available to us upon 
observation and conclusion of his burial. And as the only daughter most of his 
properties were willed to me, most importantly is the sum of US$35M (thirty five million United States 
dollars)which he deposited in a private security company in Europe which is also among my inheritance from my 
deceased father. 

I obviously know that it might be very difficult for you to believe my story but it is what is really happing to me now for
upon introduction of this WILL all my father's relatives have not been at peace with me, they were 
not happy how my father assigned all the enormous wealth to me. As a poor girl, they have systematically and forcefully 
collected from me all documents of the properties 'willed' to me. Not including a huge amount of money at ARE Bank of
sierra Leone which they could not withdrawn due to a court order restraining either party from making withdrawals pending the determination of a Litigation filled by my father's relations 
challenging the WILL. Now since I am too hard for them{ the relatives) to subdue, they were making 
attempts to kill me so that nobody can stop them from carrying out their act, as they have succeeded in 
killing my mother last year. Infact the fear and warning of killing me has well griped me so much that I could 
not bear it anymore, hence I ran away from our family house to live with a school mate of mine whose father 
is a military man,with advise of my father*s lawyer to safeguard my life. 

Considering my age and inexperienced in business and investment procedures, please I want you to help me 
in  retreving this fund which I will use to  invest  in a profitable venture in a country where there is
Economic and political stability.  And if I may ask.......

 1 .Is your country good for such investment???

Because I do not want to make mistake.
 
2 Can you help me???? without trying to double cross me

If you assent to help me in this regard, we shall then discuss what I will give you in return for your assistance. And before I disclose anything, we  will firstly have to sign a Memorandum of Understanding 
 upon which  you shall proceed to the official premises of the Security Company to take delivery of 
the funds which I will use for  forfurther investment with your help or with the help of another person pending what comes out between us.
Please put into consideration my incapabilities in some respects, therefore I would prefer all correspondence 
to be through Email which is more secret and confidential, as I can not use my school mate father's telephone 
to avoid jeopardizing my staythere. Every document concerning these funds is with me, upon request I will sent it to you if need be. .
Should you not be willing to collaborate with me in this, please inform me urgently to enable me look 
for another person. Or you email me at princesshasihatu@yahoo.com.hk.
Thanks in anticipation to your positive response.

Regards.
PRINCESS HASIHATU SESSEY COLA.

The total sum, ?6,500,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. In accordance with the Federal banking Laws and constitution,the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds.

TEL: +27 839 820 957

Dear Sir,
 
I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise, but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy.
 
My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare, Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin, a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country, Zimbabwe.
 
My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers, and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world, even up to date, Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy, he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.
After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released, Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm.
 
We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage, Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today, they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp, where we have been since December 2003.
 
Why I am writing you are that, when my father was alive, he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20,500,000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money was
gotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life.
 
My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee, I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family, since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.

Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us, please contact us on above email, fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser.
 
I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait for
your urgent reply.

I am Mrs.Azura Amanda Akub. I came across your contact details 
in my desperate search for immediate assistance. I have just arrived at 
Cotonou, Bene Republic, thinking of how to settle/start life again because 
I am just having rest of mind now, since then. After fleeing renewed fighting 
In Sierra-Leone. Of the 2,030 of us who ran from the village, just 78 of 
Us made it across the boarder. 
I lost my husband and daughter during this flight 
And I am left with a son. There is a pain in my heart because I haven't 
See or heard peace in the last 10 years. Just bloodshed and sorrow. I 
Wonder if it will ever end. 
I seek your help in retrieving money belonging to my husband. My late 
Husband, DR.Ejiro Akub, was a devoted family man and a very successful 
Diamond /Gold trader in the region of Bo in Sierra-Leone. We were a happy 
Family of four (4) before the beginning of the civil war in 2000.We 
Were forced to seek refuge in the neighboring country of Benin Rep. while 
The war was going on, so we hid our life savings in the family tomb and 
Fled. We returned when we heard news of a peace treaty signed in 2003. 
We were deceived. The war escalated beyond imagination and it was 
Nothing but sorrow tears and blood the rebels left in its wake. I and 
My husband sold our remaining cache of Diamonds /Gold to a Lebanese 
Middle man and was paid cash for it. The funds were then shipped out of 
The country to Europe using the ""Diamond /Gold trade Route�, which he was 
Very familiar with (it was how Sierra-Leone Diamonds and Gold ends up 
In capital cities of developed Nations). We then make plans to move and 
settle in Europe as we were tired of the bloodshed,but unfortunately it was 
Not to be. 
Our village was raided. It was during the operation no living thing embarked 
Upon by the Fonday Sankoh- Led Ruf rebel forces that I lost my husband 
And daughter. 
Now, I and my surviving son have been going through hell while the 
Funds are trapped with a security company in Europe. We lost our traveling 
Documents in our haste to escape the fighting and beside we do not have 
Any money on us. all We had was lost in the flight 
Out of the worst fighting areas. What we need now is an individual who 
Have compassion on the poor window of my type and come to her aid by 
Retrieving this funds from the security company by means of 
Claiming/clearing the consignment. 
This consignment contain the money for security reasons, 
The funds total at least US$ 38.5 million Dollars and GB# 7.82 million 
Pounds. This money is kept with the security company inform of 
Consignment for security reasons. nobody except me knows about this, I am 
Willing to offer you a commission for your assistance depending on what is 
Agreed upon by both of us. I will like to tell you that 10% ofeach said 
Amount goes for expenses. 
All you have to do is, send me your immediate response. All necessary 
Information�s and deposit certificate of the security company will be 
Send to you when due, and both (secret and answers to preset questions) 
And location of security company with this, you can claim the money,

1,"Dear Friend,   REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.    I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.    We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, weremandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.     However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.      We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.      This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitivepositions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.       I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.       Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very greatimportance for security reasons.       Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.        Yours Faithfully,         Dr. Peter Olis.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------Encuentra tu casa rápida y cómodamente.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB
Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at
US$40,000,000.00,
(forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his
holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out
that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin
was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.
Barry
Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for
Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British
Law, at
the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the
owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes
though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I
tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because
I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign
account or have an account that is more than $1m.
I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company
so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is
simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in
place as the as the owner of the boxes.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me
and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address
upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like
houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)
Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we
can have a smooth communication.
Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )

Thanks and regards.

My name is Mr. Felix Kambala, the manager credit and foreign bills of African Developement Bank Ltd Dakar Senegal Branch . I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/adb/t, Mr.Gerald Smith who died in a plane crash (EgyptAir Flight 990)which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31st,1999 with other passengers on board.You can view this web site for more story of the inccident http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html 
Since the death of this customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$13,000,000.00(Thirteen Million Dollars) which has been with my bank for a very long time. On this note I decided to seek for whose name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
In view of this I got your contact through my country?s foreign trade mission after I was convinced by providence that your name could be used as the next of kin.The request of the foreigner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by thefact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalias cannot stand as the next of kin to a Foreign client

I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect of providing a new bank account or we can use your old accountinformation,while the rest will be for me, thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement as I am almost due for retirement.Therefore, to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as
arranged, we must engage the services of a lawyer to apply on your behalf to the bank as a relation to the deceased.I need you to indicate in your response, your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and your complete bank information where the money will be remitted into for our mutual benefit. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send you by fax or e-mail the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as every modality and machinery for the success of this transaction have been put in place. 
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this
letter strictly on email for security reasons.

DEAR ,

This letter was borne out of my sincere desire to establish a 
business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the 
international trade and commerce (ITCC).

My name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the former 
deputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who was 
killed and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma after 
overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do not 
know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbance in 
Sierra-Leone but the pressure of war drove my mother and I out of Sierra 
-Leone into exile in South Africa where we have been living under political 
asylum for years.

Sadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in South 
Africa . Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a 
secret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe 
the deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this 
was the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat 
of the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it as a 
family tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the 
end of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a result 
of his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the 
Security/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.

Due to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the 
participation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will 
assist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement 
for the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The 
security/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, they 
believe that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. 
Unfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the 
consignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your assistance. 
I cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total ignorance of 
the business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your 
assistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment while 
the rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. 
i would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the next of 
kin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i will not 
be allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by the 
goverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to open an 
account as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount of 
money,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are interested 
in helping me out of this my present situation, contact me immediately 
through my email and i will funish you with other details you need to 
conclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and of 
biliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing it 
up.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also your 
home addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance company 
handling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will then 
make an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and discuss in 
details.

Meanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents for 
now,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to join 
you in your country so that i can continue my studies over there. I hope to 
hear from you soon

Best regards,

I was terrified of the situation and because of this I escaped with my son David from Sierra - Leone to cote d' Ivoire into a refugee camp but brought along the sum of u.s$12.5 million , in a metallic box and presently in a security company as family valuables . 
 
My aim of contacting you is to seek for your able assistance as a front in transferring this fund abroad into an  account , then as a business developer , you can help us to invest wisely in areas you deem lucrative and finally obtain a residential permit for us to stay comfortable in your country of abode . 
 
Presently we cannot go back to Sierra- Leone because of the situation there and you know that cote d' Ivoire where we are now is politically unstable; we therefore wish you could help us get out of here before it become worse.

Dear Sir/Madam, 

May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It 
is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting 
between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the 
business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and 
appropriate shares accordingly.

I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very 
confidential business proposition. 

On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy, 
Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 
US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. 
Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we 
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. 

On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or 
relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 
US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward 
to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money 
which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a 
foreign account. 

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my 
attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and 
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the 
beneficiary of the funds. 

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork 
for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this 
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide 
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. 

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction, which is of mutual benefit.
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.

SHARE: -
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be entitled to 30% of the money, 60% will be for me and my partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses. 

I would require the following: -
1. Your company's names, address telephones and fax numbers.
2. The bank where the money will be remitted to.

The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.

We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government starts auditing all Federal Government owned Parstatals.
Please contact me immediately through my private mailbox (tobi4120a@k.ro). If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you are interested, send the required documents aforementioned herein through my above mailbox, as time is of the essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Mr.James Tobi

may sound strange but I seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously. 
 
Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over 
invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over 
invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now 
desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR 
into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us. 
  
 For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred 
by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be 
for my partners and myself. 
  
  I would require the following: 
  1)Bank details ( Name and address / Account no/Beneficiary name )

company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
  More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields

contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we 
have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the 
business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw

My name is Mr.Hoffman Bancoley, manager of the above named
financial institution.I am a Ghanaian married with two kids.
I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of
$4,550.000 U.S Dollars.

This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager
made as profit during the 2004 financial year. I have already submitted
annual report for that year to my head office here in Accra as I have
watched with keen interest as they will never know of this excess.
I have since, placed this amount of $4,550.000 U.S Dollars on
an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary (anonymous) to avoid trace.
As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus
I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your
bank account on my behalf.

I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do 
need
to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It's going to 
be
a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original
depositor of this fund so that the fund can be transferred to your account.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to my
private email.....mancoleyghanac@latinmail.com

General overseer of the Gold and Diamond Mining 
Corporation in Kanema Sierra Leone. During the crisis the military
forces loyal to the 
Government of AHMED TIJAN KABBAH invaded the Diamond 
and Gold mine and assassinated my husband, mistaking him for his brother
MR.MIKE SAMBU who is the 
deputy to the leader of the Revolutionary United 
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH. When the news reached me, 
I hurriedly gathered some valuables in our family 
villa and escaped for my dear life in the company of 
my only son SILAS SAMBU and left some other valuables 
since I was in a haste and lost some. Among the 
valuables I collected was a file that contained 
details of a Deposit in a Vault my husband made in a 
security company in Europe. 
He deposited US$8M (Eight Million U.S Dollars) 
contained in one box in the name of our son SILAS SAMBU. He did not
disclose the real contents of 
the Box to the Security Company. He Declared the 
contents as Family Valuables for safety reasons. This 
is the money he made from the sale of Gold and 
diamonds during his time as the General overseer. Now that we are in
Accra,Ghana and verified the 
transaction, we need your assistance to move this 
funds out of the security company for investment in 
your country as we cannot invest here due to its 
nearness to our country and the insecurity still going 
on there. We ask you to scout for a viable and 
lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely. We 
have it in mind to give you 10% of the total sum of 
(8 million US Dollars), and 12% share for you in any 
investment we will embark upon with our share of 90% 
if you assist us. We will also set aside 5% of the 
funds for ancillary expenses which you will make in 
course of this transaction. 
This fortune of ours we have revealed to you should 
remain CONFIDENTIAL as it is only you who we have told 
about it. Kindly indicate your interest and 
willingness to assist us on receipt of this message 
for us to clarify you on how to proceed. Note that this transaction is
risk free. 
May the shelter and care of God be upon you as you 
assist us. 
Remain blessed. 

Yours Sincerely,

1,">From Mr.Ctibor Pilna. # 18 SILVER CRESCENT JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA. #874-763-427980.  Fax874-763-427981.                  (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL) Dear Sir/Madam, In order to transfer from a Bank some amount of money,I have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in the future. I am Mr.Ctibor Pilna,a consulting auditor of prime banks here in South Africa. On June 6,1998,an American Mining onsultant/contractor with the South African Mining corporation, Mr.Gregory A.Williams made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months,value US $14,200,000.00 an account. On maturity, The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month,The bank sent another reminder and finally his contract employers,the South African Mining corporation wrote to inform the bank that Mr.Gregory A.Williams died from an automobile accident,that he died without MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore, made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Gregory A.Williams in fact was an immigrant from Jamaica and only recently obtained American citizenship.He did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paper work. This money total U S $ 14,200,000.00 is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account.  No one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to South African banking policy,after 5years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if the account owner is certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Gregory A.Williams,and a Bank Account abroad will then facilitate the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/ next of kin. This is simple, all you have to do is to immediately send me a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork. This money total USD ($14.2M) will then be paid into this Account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25 % for you and 5% for expenses that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, and all the paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position and connection in the banks in South Africa. This business transaction is guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply immediately through my personal email sending the following details: (1) Your Full Name/Address. (2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number.

RE: PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.


I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years, before he died in the year 2000.We were both married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is all against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.6Million (Eighteen Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company in Europe for safe keeping. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition of health I have decided to donate this fund to churches, orphanage or a better Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use these fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to nderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. As I do not want a situation whereby this money will be used in an ungodly manner.

Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also due of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/ Security Company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this said fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here in.


Hoping to hearing from you.

N.B-
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE MY LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IMMEDIATELY, HE IS PRESENTLY UNDERGOING SEMINAL RESEACH IN WEST AFRICA, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S A VERY UNDERSTANDING PERSON AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS.

Victoria Island Lagos 
Website: http://www.allstatesbanking.com

Dear Sir, 

I hope this will not meet you as a surprise, as I know that I have not 

heard any previous corressponding with you, but have taken interest in 

you, as a result of my choice of investment. I am Okpara Addey, 

Managing Director, Corporate Audit ,Allstate Trust Bank, Nigeria. This 

is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. I am seeking 

your assistance here to enable me transfer and  invest the sum of $24M 

in LANDED PROPERTIES there in  your country. The source of these funds 

is as follows:

On June 6, 2002,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian 

Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Steve Warren, made a numbered 

time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 

US$24,000,000.00,(Twenty-Four Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 

but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we 

discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian Institute of 

Mining and Metallurgy, that Mr.Steve Warren died from an automobile 

accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without 

making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Steve 

Warren did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official 

documents, including his Bank Deposit documents in my Bank. This sum of 

US$24,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. 

No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to the Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, 

the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody 

applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that, since Mr.Steve Warren is a 

Foreigner, I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of 

the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you 

because I as a public servant, I cannot operate a foreign account, and 

moreso, my choice of investment, which is one of the reasons why I 

would want you to assist me, as I will need your assistance to invest 

these funds in the Real Estate  business, to which which any PROFIT 

RETURN will be shared under an agreed percentage between the both of 

us, outside the normal percentage to be agreed on for your assistance.

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to 

claim them. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your 

full names and address, as well as phone and fax numbers,so that all  

the neccessary document can be  prepared , which will put you in place 

as the beneficiary of the funds.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me 

and 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done in 

accordance to the law of the land and this guarantees the successful 

execution of this transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address 

at: amokpara007@yahoo.co.uk, and upon your response,I shall provide 

you with more details and relevant documents that will help you 

understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this 

transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 

require your assistance to invest my share in Real Estate  within your 

country. This is the major reason why I have contacted you.

Due to the nature and confidentiality in this Transaction, it should be 

accorded all the neccesary confidentiality required, as my job will be 

at stake in the event of any eventuality.   I hope that this will meet 

you in a good state of mind.

I will pause for now, as I await your urgent response

Sir,
I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.
My name is Mohammed Tankoh,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Tankoh who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)""Bouake"" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.
After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance house in the Capital city of Senegal (Dakar) and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .
Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce to the Finance house where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adressfor security reason.

 I am Mr.Soo Cho, credit officer of CHO HUNG BANK. I have an
urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 
 On July 8, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with
the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Phillip
Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
calendar months, valued at (Twenty-eight Million Three
Hundred Thousand American Dollars only) in my branch.
 
 Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent
a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers, that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an auto-mobile
accident.
 
 On further investigation, I found out that he died without
making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.
 
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that
Mr.Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in
all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in my Bank.This sum of $28,300,000.00 is still
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over

 According to Laws of South Korea, at the expiration of

South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 
 Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip

Dearest: Friend,

My Name is Mr.Andre Koffi a credit officer with the one
of the leading Bank (Finance Trust House) here in Cotonou Republic Du Benin.
In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of (USD 32 m)  in an account
that belongs to one of our foreigncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich,
Germany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.

stm Since i got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some
body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash
leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that
I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here
stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Five years, the money
will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of
foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and an Indigen cannot stand as next of kin to a
foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision
of a foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the
business,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charity
organisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for me
Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the
percentage indicated .

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you
must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the
money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application .

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required
arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting
to hear from you immediately.

Yours Faithfully,
Mr.Andre Koffi

Dear Sir,
 
With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal believing that it will receive the most
desired attention from you even as we have not had any
previous correspondence, Although, I am constrained by
insufficient information about you, but I will express
in full the main objectives of this proposal .
 
I am Mr.CHRIS ANDERSON Personal Aide and in-law to the
former President of the Liberian Mr. Charles Taylor,
who resigned his post due to pressure from the
International Community in order to maintain peace in
west African Region. His Excellency who is currently
behind bars at a U.N.-backed court in Hague
Netherlands, facing 11 counts of war crimes during the
country's 1991-2002 civil war. Liberian Government In
conjunction with Sierra Leone Government has agreed on
June 20, 2006 for security reason to Hand him over to
U.N War crime Special Court in Hague, Netherlands.
 
His Excellency who was arrested on a boarder between
Nigeria  and Cameroun of which he instructed me to
escape with all his vital documents so that he could
face a U.N.-backed tribunal for war crime charges
which he is now currently facing. but before this new
unfolding events. Though our original plan was after
successful crossing to Cameroun un-noticed, I will
proceed to Accra Ghana totake the task of arranging
for the immediate evacuation of the money in whish he
deposited in the custody of Security Finance Company
before it will be discovered by International
Community or Liberian Government.See the website for
more details

http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html
http://somalinet.com/news/world/Africa/10893
 
His Excellency, while in jail has mandated me to
secure the co-operation of a trust worthy and reliable
firm or individual as fund managers to whom he will
entrust certain amount of money to be managed within
the period while he is in jail, on the terms as shall
be agreed by both parties. The new government in
Liberia lead by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sir leaf has
initiated moves to probe Mr. Taylor�s governance while
in office with a view of recovering his assets and
deposits and repatriating such to the country as was
the case with the Late Head of State of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha as advised by
the International Community on Liberian Government.
 
On the wake of hostilities in Liberia and the break
out of war between the rebels and the allied forces,
the Liberian government being under an arms embargo by
the U.N could not import arms officially, so Mr.
Taylor resolved to illegal arms deal from the West
African Region of Ghana, which was transacted by cash
monies, within this period, he succeeded in depositing
a total sumof USD$115M only, in cash money derived
from the arms dealing custody of Security Finance
Company in Accra Ghana. Which is the trust company
from where the arms deal was financed?
 
we intends to execute a deed of conveyance of this
deposit to a capable and trust worthy firm or
individual who will immediately effect a change of
beneficiary on the deposit and release it from the
custody of Security Finance Company by way of
terminating the deposit contract to avoid any trace
and repatriation of the deposit by the new government
in Liberia.
 
Terms of the transaction shall be discussed and
agreement entered into when you indicate your ability
to handle and manage funds of this magnitude under a
strict confidential understanding..
Please treat as most confidential due to the sensitive
information given in here strictly to you.
 
Yours sincerely

1,"Good day,

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact that
you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in my private search
for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction
of this nature in respect of this, I got your contact through an uprooted
search on the internet. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that allwill
be well at the end of the day.

I am Frank Williams, son of late Dr John Williams of Sierra Leone who was
killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th of December,1999 in
my country Sierra Leone.
When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box containing the sum of
US$10,000,000.00 with one private security and safe deposit company and
declared the box as containing African Artwork for export to a foreign partner.

This money was made from the sale of Gold and Diamond and he already decided
to use this money for future investment of the family before he died.Recently,
I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to locate where my late father
kept the depository agreement and the certificate of deposit that was given
to him by the security company when he deposited the consignment in their
custody.
I have confirmed from the security company that the consignment is with
them, when I demanded for the release of the consignment to me in my capacity
of being the son of Dr Williams, the depositor of the consignment, I was
told that in the absence of my father, the only person that can demand for
the funds is my late father?s foreign partner on whose behalf the consignment
was deposited.

When my late father deposited the consignment, he did not give the name
or gender of his foreign partner on whose behalf he was depositing the consignment,
he made the declaration for security reasons as he did not want the securitycompany
to inspect the contents of the consignment hence he declared thebox as belonging
to his foreign partner.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of his death, that
I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out thismoney
from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to retrieve and transfer this
fund into your Account, but I will demand from you if you could be able
to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require
much technical expertise in your country where this fund will be invested?

I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transactionbased
on the trust I have established on you. For your assistance in thistransaction,
I have decided to compensate you with 10 percent of the total amount at
the end of this business.
The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I wouldlike
you to keep this business very confidential.

I shall expect an early response from you.
Thank you and God bless.
Yours sincerely,
Frank Williams

Dear Sir,
My names are  Mac  Johnson  Bonida, I am the inmediate
young brother to Mrs Jewel Charles Taylor of  war
tored country of Liberia-westAfrica, the wife of (Mr
Charles Taylor) president of Liberia.
After a peace deal in Ghana few weeks ago, my sister
called me for introduction of what need to be done
inmediately that her properties are no longer safe. He
asked me to meet her contact in Ivory Coast to arrange
my journey to Eruope. She said  that she had made
contact with a  Security company to move a truck box
containing $30,000,000.00 US Dollars,  Thirty  Million
United State Dollars Only, and that the security
company label the box which the funds are contained in
as a box containing Africa artifacts.
The Company has confirmed the arrival of  this
consignment in their  office in Netherlands.
I left for Ivory-Coast  for my journey to Europe and
at this moment I am in Netherlands but owing to what
is happening in my country this time, my sister can
not do nothing as to Claim the Consignment and she
want this deal to be a confidential transaction, so
she asked me to contact any partner  who could stand
as a beneficiary of this truck box, so that after the
beneficiary must have claimed the box the money will
be channeled into good business investments with low
risk.
She has agreed to give 10% of the total fund to you
for assistance and moving of the fund to your private
account in your country for the purpose of the
investment. While 5% of the total fund will cover your
expense during this transaction, and another 5% for
me. You can contact me if you are interested by my
e-mail address or kindly call me on this Netherlands
telephone number, .
I would be glad if you can help me out to complete
this transcation and transfer this fund into your
private account. Please endeavour to keep this
transaction as confidentail as much as possible
because my Sister and her husband is in trouble over
the war in my country-Liberia.

Dear Sir, 
BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY 

I got your contact through our chember of commerce and 
industry.

I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship
and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business
venture that we will operate together.
After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and
contact you for this partnership.
My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of
Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the
22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was 
assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown
person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.
My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in
Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a
hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to
injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me
about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States
Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with
one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.
That he willed the money to me in his will, with his
attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner
Who will assist me in transferring the money out of
Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for
investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement
after the transfer to leave this country. That those
people that killed him may be after me.
According to my late fathers will, the money cannot
be released to me without a foreign partner until at
the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from
the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner 
before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am
34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years
waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in
danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist
me present your self as my foreign partner and also
provide foreign account where this fund will be
transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers
attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is
waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to
start the process for the transfer of the funds.
I would have done this since but according to our
tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my
fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking
on such project. So that it will not look like if I am
just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of
my father, I have been with my fathers brother in
Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me 
to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my
late fathers death. 
Based on this, I left his house with out his consent.
Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont
know my way about and will never know. This is why I
need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this
transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this
Country.
You will be given 40% as compensation for your
assistance and effort before any thing is done with
the money. If you are interested and feel that you
can handle this project. Please get back to me for
more details and as well as indicate your private
Tel/Fax numbers where I can always reach you, when
the need arises.
I await to hear from you.
Thanks and God bless.

1,"Dear friend,
I got your contact from an email directory and decided to contact you for assistance. I am the son of Jonas Savimbi the rebel leader in Angola who was short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the opposing Angolan Army.
. PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WEB PAGE FOR IT SAYS ALL.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm
Before the death of my father he had transferred the sum of $16,000,000.00 (Sixteen million dollars) through a security company in South Africa to Europe.
All the legal documents for the deposit and transfer of this fund to Europe are with my mother which my father gave to her for safe keeping. After the death of my father I and my family fled to South Africa where we are currently living.And we have been trying to fly to Europe but it
has been difficult for us to get visas from Africa.
So we want you to help us make claims of this fund ($16m) in Europe as my family beneficiary and transfer the money to your account or any account of your choice before I and my family can get visas to fly down to your country so that we can share this money.
My family have agreed to give you 10%, which would be ($1.6Million dollars) of this Money for your assistance, and 87% would be for us and the other 3% would be set aside for any expenses that we may incure during the course of this transaction. And part of our share of 87% would be invested in your country in any profitable business proposed by you. While a large part of our share will also be used to help charity organizations.
We have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account.
Please if you are interested get to me through my email address to enable me feed you with more details and all necessary documentations.
Please treat this as confidential

1,"Dear 
I am Miss Franca Roland and my brother Mr David Roland, the first and only son of late Mr Mputa Roland and my aged mother, my father was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe, Before the death of my father, he had deposit the sum of US$4,000,000 (FOUR MILLION US DOLLARS), in a private security and Finance company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of chemicals and tractors for the development of our new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when the Zimbabwe president Mr Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform act, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some black farmers. This result to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society lot of people have been killed because of this land-reform act, which my father is one of them. You can hook up to CNN news every day for what is happening in the country, if you are in doubt, you can also go to the internet to www.dailynews.co.zw , it is against this backdrop that my family and I who are currently in Dakar Senegal decided to transfer our fathers money to any foreign account since the Senegal law prohibits refugees (asylum seekers) to operate any type of bank account or to be involved in any huge financial transaction. As the eldest child of my father, I am seeking for a genuine foreign partner who can help us transfer this money into his or her oversea account. On the other hand, the senegal government seems to be playing along with them.
We are therefore faced with the dilemma of investing this money in Senegal for the fear of going through the same experience in future, since both countries have similar political history. As a business man whom I will entrust my future and that of my entire family in his or her hands , I must let you know that this business is completely 100% risk-free. As we cannot accept to venture into any dangerous deal with our fortune, if you therefore accept to assist us, which I know that you will. 
Please I will like you to contact me through the receipt of this mail urgently. Feel free to ask all questions you deem necessary. For you assistance , we have proposed two options for you. 1)You may go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. 2)If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 15% of the sum while the remaining 85% will be my family prior for investment in your country, while the remaining 5% will be used to defray all the expenses that may incur during the process of this transaction. You are therefore required of absolute confidentiality of this matter. God bless you. Yours truly, 
Miss Franca.

  Johannesburg, South Africa.

  Dear Sir / Madam,
I am Mark Andreas,  the son of comrade Border Andreas who was the former Zimbabwean Minister for youth, gender and Employment creation. While alive, my father stood against seizure of white farms and it's distribution  to the blacks without compensation to the white owners.
 
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction / business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the transaction described hereunder for the benefit of all parties involved and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
 
Because of what is happening in the world today and to verify my predicaments as well as my sincerity, I would like you to visit the site below to read more about my father.
 Www.Mweb.co.zw/standard/index.php? id=2908&pubdate=2001-04-29
www.dailynews.co.zw/daily/2001/December/December4/3891.htm1
www.zimbabwewhitefarmers.co.zw
 
Because of my fathers sincerity, he was killed by a planned motor accident along Harare-Masvingo Road near Mvuma Province of Zimbabwe. But before his untimely death, my father told me some few weeks earlier that he kept a box with a private Security and finance Company in Johannesburg, South Africa which contains US$20.5 Million (Twenty million, five hundred thousand United States dollars). He warned that he only declared the contents of the box to the Security and finance Company as family treasure/ valuables, with insurance values of the said amount. He also told me that he used my name as the beneficiary of this money being his first child.
 
The original document that shows the Deed of lodge, Proof of Deposit, and Depository Agreement between my late father and the Management of the Security Company was kept with my mother.
 
After my fathers death, mother, my little sister and I ran to South Africa to seek asylum for our lives. Because of the South African financial law which prohibits asylum seekers/refugees like my mother and I to open bank account or involve in any financial transaction, I decided to write to you to seek your assistance for this money to be transferred into your companys or personal bank account while all arrangement for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care of.
I have the authority of my family to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$5.125m (25%), while my family takes US$13.325m (65%) and the balance of US$2.5m (10%) for miscellaneous expenses that may be incurred by either party during the transfer.
 
I want to let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality because the Zimbabwean Government are bent on collecting  all assets / properties belonging to my late father.
 
Please, I do hope that this money will be safe when finally transferred into your account and I do hope of establishing a good relationship with you and your family after this transaction. I wait to hear from you.
 
Regards & God bless,
Mr. Mark Andreas

Greetings, 

My name is RABI AL SALIH, wife of MAHAMMED MAHDI AL SALIH,the former 
Iraqi minister for Interior Affairs. I got your email address through the internet while searching for a reliable person to help me and I believe you can be able to help me and my family.
 
My husband was captured on 23 April 2003 by the US forces. My Husband 
is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of terrorism, corruption, embezzlement and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. During my husband's regime as Minister for Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from 
various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this 
money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. 
My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. 

Before the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of 
$12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold belonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you 
because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my 
behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. 

I trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. 
when I receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary 
informations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim the money. I shall also let you know where the security company is and the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very important. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my instructions.

For now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are tight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will give more details when I receive your reply.

Yours Sincerely,
Rabi.

I am Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi a member of the Presidential
Payment Verification Committee (PPVC) of the Federal
Government of Nigeria, West Africa and also a Director
of Project Implementation with the NNPC. I am
presently on assignment with my colleagues in the
ministry of finance and the presidency carrying out
routine verification of contractual claims on behalf
of the NNPC 
I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a
Transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on
this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you, as a respected and honest person to
handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and
confidentiality.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the process of actualising our dreams
described hereunder. For the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it in confidence because of the
nature of this transaction within the NNPC and
Ministry of Finance (FMF), where I work as Director of
Project Implementation.
With the cooperation of four other top officials, we
have in our possession overdue payment bills which we
are presently verifying, to the tune of Twenty Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds. 
More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as
the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to
operate offshore account hence your importance in the
whole transaction. 
This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately in the course of our verification
exercise. Though the actual contract cost have been
paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance
in the tune of the said amount which we have in
principle gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filing in an application
to NNPC and the Ministry of Finance for the transfer
of Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum to
you/your account. 
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the
transaction, your share of the sum would be 30% of
the $26.5million, 60% for us, while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality. 
Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
would not disappoint me. 
Should you be interested or not in this transaction, 
please notify me through this private
email: chris4120@primposta.com
 or to call me with the tel number
above. If not also let us know, so as to enable us
enough time to scout for another credible foreign
partner or not to help carry out this transaction.
I assure you that my partners and I are in a position
to make the payment of this claim possible provided
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee
that our share would be secured and please always
remember to treat this matter with the utmost
confidentiality, as any form of exposure would
compromise our positions in this government, being
active Government Civil Servants. 
Once again, remember time is of great essence in this
transaction. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
Yours faithfully,

  I will like to put a proposal to you. i am not by in any way compelling you.Brief information about myself.
  
I am the only Daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.rich. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.
  
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad on the 12th September 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of
his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so special. 

Before his death on September 2004, he called me and informed me that he has the sum of Nine Million, Seven Hundred thousand United State
Dollars.(USD$9,700,000.00)left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks in Africa. He further told me that he deposited the money in my name, and also gave me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the bank.

I am just 20 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your country till such a time that it will be convinient for me to return back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant
political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business world.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account? 

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Immedaitely I confirm your willingness, I will also inform you more details involved in this matter.

Kind Regards,
Miss linda rich

 I was only twenty-three years old prior to my fathers death. He entrusted to my mother who was his favorite wife certain documents. The documents were Deposit Bond Certificate of two trunk cases containing the sum    (USD18.5Million)  and sum family treasures which my father deposited in a security Financial   institution in europe with the name of my mother.  These Deposit Certificates and Bond of the cases were hidden in an underground  Cellar in the Mansion known only to my mother until my fathers death.Then my elder half-brother took over as the president, he confiscated all our late fathers properties including his bank accounts and other family  possessions.My mother was worse hit as she was driven out of the family house while I was declare wanted in the course of fleeing the  Mansion. My other was able to  smuggle the documents out of the cellar.

 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO

 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW 
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH

Dear Sir/Madam,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.
I will introduce myself as a staff in the accounts management section of
a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom. 

One of our accounts with holding balance of Ł15,000,000(Fifteen Million
British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
4 years. 

>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account a foreigner
by name Austin Martins died in August 2000 and since then nobody has done
anything As regards the claiming of this money because he has no family
members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds.
Also Information From the National Immigration states that he was also single
on entry into the UK.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and
we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus
propose to do Business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have
been followed. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you.


Regards,

Gordon.

When my late Husband was alive he deposited the sum of $15.5million (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars) with a Finance Company in oversea. Recently,my doctor told me that I have only six months to live due to cancer problem.

I want this Muslim organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund mosques, orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold step.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christian's converts and I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an Unholy manner.Hence the reasons for this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.

           (URGENT AND CONFIDENTAIL BUSINESS)

Dear sir, 

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred
and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$
142,000,000.00) from South Africa. 

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide
either an existing bank account or to set up a new
bank account immediately to receive this money,though
an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long
as you will remain honest to me till the end of this
important business trusting in you and believing in
God that you will never let me down either now or in
time to come. 

I am Dr. Tony Devon the external auditor of a
Bank.During the course of our auditing,I discovered a
floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1995
and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account
again.After going through some old files in the
records, I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a ""Heir apparent to the throne"" hence the
money is floating and if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. 

The owner of this account is  a foreigner and an
industrialist died, since 1995,until now no other
person(s) knows about this account or could give any
documentary evidence concerning this account. As such
this account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that until his
death was the manager Oriental Diamond Company,in
South Africa. 

However, if you are interested in this business we
will start the first money transfer with Forty Two
Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from
you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the
remaining amount to your account. 

While the total amount involved is One hundred and
Forty Two Million United States Dollars
(U.S.$142,000,000.00)only. I would want us to make a
first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States
Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can
not be approved to a local account, without valid
international foreign ""Agreement"", but could only be
approved to any foreigner with valid international
credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign
account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the
former owner of the account is a foreigner too, thus
the money
could only be approved into a foreign account. 

However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding
agreement in this regards.As a matter of urgency, 
I will inform you the next step to take, while you
Send your private telephoneand fax number including
the full details of the account to be used for the
deposit. 

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together
before transferring the money to any account of your
choice where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to
your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments,I
need your full co-operation to make this business a
success, because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to
you,upon your positive response and once I am
convinced that you are capable and will meet up with
the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never let me down. 

With my influence and the position in the bank we can
transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account which you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in
your country for sharing.

And to build confidence that you can come immediately
to discuss with me face to face after which I will
make this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the account. 

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act as directed.


To prove the authenticity of the business I will use
my position and influence to obtain all legal
approvals for onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance from the relevant
ministries, foreign exchange departments, embassy and
Board of Internal Revenue Services. 

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during this process. 

I look forward to your earliest reply

My dear friend, 

I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

Mr. Yetunde Bassey

1,"Dear Sir,

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business. It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below: May I first introduce my self: I am Dr.(Mrs.) MARIAM ABACHA, the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June 1998. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband. I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person , I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$8 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).

This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping. This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons. it is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation ""FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM"" (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf. On your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta, the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Swizerland,UK,Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport ,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband.

In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the will ,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas accuount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation. In the meantime, there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we annot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $8 Million US Dollars. In that case,when the money ($8 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour ,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur or tax as your government may require . The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. My cousin (Dr.yemi musa) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation. What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner. And in due course, all contacts must be made through cousin Dr yemi musa whom is presently staying in Senegal through this E-mail: ma23200210@zipmail.com.br and ma232002@box.az and phone:+221-5478858.I look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co-operation. In view of all above details, I request you to keep this letter and co-operation highly confidential.

Best wishes,

MRS. MARIAM ABACHA
pls reply to ma232002@box.az"
1,"Beloved,

I am sorry for my unannounced communication with you especially through this common method but I promise to give you more reasons for this in due course.

I am Nopparat Sujaritpinij from Thailand (nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com). I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black ""war veterans"" who in one of their attacks shot and killed him.

In case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any international news media like; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1878846.stm , http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/03/18/zimbabwe020318.html.

Well, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.

I successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company's account.

Please, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no risk is involved.

In dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.

I will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every details of myself as well as that of the transaction.

Regards,

Nopparat Sujaritpinij

Dear Sir,

In order to transfer out (US$12 Million) Twelve Million United States
Dollars from ABSA .I have picked-up the trust and courage to write you
this letter with divine confidence that you are a reliable and honest
person who will be capable for this important business transaction
 believing also that you will never let me down either now or in the
future.

My name is Mr. Jeffrey Daniels a senior Auditing Officer with
the ABSA Bank in South Africa.There is an account opened in this bank
in
1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After
going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do
not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account died since 1990. No other person knows about
this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this
company
does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is
(US$12 million)Twelve million United States Dollars.I want to transfer
this sum of Twelve  million United States Dollars into a safe foreign
account abroad.I am contacting you based on the fact that you are a
foreigner because this money can only be approved for payment to a
foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local bank here, as
this
money is in US Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a
foreigner too.
I know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise as we don't
know ourselves before. however I got your contact from an inter net
consultant here in South Africa, though I did not disclose the
purpose of
my seeking for a foreign business partner to him.
Although we will still have to meet possibly, sign some agreement
before the final transfer of the fund into any of your chosen
designated bank account. I have involved a very senior official in the
operational department and we have agreed that after the transfer of
the
money into your account, you shall be entitled to 25% of the total
sum,
we the officials will take 70% while 5% is for expenses.

All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a risk free
situation on the side of both parties.
 Please note that this deal can only take place on the following
 conditions:-
1.You will provide the bank account and other relevant
particulars/information for easy and onward Remittance
of this money.
2.Absolute confidentiality and sincerity will be
required and guaranteed, considering our (me and my
partners) positions in the bank.
3.Assurance that our own due share will be released to
us in good faith when this money finally gets into
your account.

All things being equal, this transaction will be within 10 working
days
as soon as we hear from you.
Please treat with utmost confidentiality. Contact me as quickly as
possible through my e-mail box,or above telephone number.

Expecting your urgent response,

Best Regards,

Mr. Jeffrey Daniels

>From . Mr. Simon Robson.
Date: 27 - 1 - 2007.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed
with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical
experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really
cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich,
I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on
my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or
make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second
chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how
I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few
close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I
have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I
want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have
Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that
my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I
once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute
the money which I have there to charity organization in United States,
Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with
what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is
the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,
000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I
will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity
organizations and use it to help those in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to
other Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and
time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am
using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to
this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my
behalf.

God be with you.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable  the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully, Trevor Gumel  (Esq.)POST  SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar MSN Toolbar Get it now!"

1,"FROM:- MRS HELLEN P. ANYANWU.
JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA.


Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you out of a painful heart and situation, which our 
president has caused us the farmers. I know   you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am HELLEN P. ANYANWU the wife of MR. EVANS PETERSON  ANYANWU, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.

 I got your contact through network online hence decided to write to you. Before the death of my husband, he was the onwer of (ANYANWU INDUSTRIES PTY LTD) in Zimbabwe a Company which specialize in Agriculture and the Supply of Agricultural Equipments. Before his murder  had taken me to South Africa to deposit the sum of USD$15. Million (Fifteen MILLION   United States Dollars) in one of the private Security Companies, as if he foresaw  the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as to avoid more demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland a small country  near Zimbabwe here. 

This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a New Land Act reform, which Wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was one of the victims.

It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my husband money to a 
foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa.

As his wife, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking for a 
genuine foreign Account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family, or I can arrange with the security company to send the money as a consignment to their sister company in your country for you to go there and sign it out.

I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If 
you accept to assist me and my family then the lawyer or consultant will help me and you in opening a non resident account in your name   which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas or you provide your address were the security company can ship it as a consignment to you. 

This money I intend to use for investment and growth in your country. I have two options; firstly you can choose to have certain Percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of this money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the   process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the 
total money while remaining 70% will remain for my family and me. If 
you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately with the above telephone number with which I have sent you this message.Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as possible. I am in dire need to leave this country with my family soonest.

Thanks for your mutual co-operation.

I expect your soonest response.

Best regards,
MRS. HELLEN ANYANWU. Please send your response to (hellenpeterson@gmail.com)
(For the family).

1,"Dear Sir,

I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of this
business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have a
re-profiling amount in an excess of US$58M, which I seek your partnership in
accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for
your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set
side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the
cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this
transaction, which I am proposing to you.

My name is Robert Bada, I am the personal assistance to the former President of
Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor
decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country
Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank
accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But
in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able,
through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$58M,
on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in
Nigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later. All the
depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my
possession


What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and
I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company
transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only
with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and
never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This
transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.

My questions are:-
 1. Can you handle this project?
 2. Can I give you this trust?
 3. can you keep this business as very confidential?
 4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your
commission?

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

YOUR REPLY:
We have a very poor internet system over here, so please reply only to my
private fax number 24317598570 or call me on telephone number 23417765782 (feel
free to call), so i can give you more clear explanations details and
information about this transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and
fax number for easy reach. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information
as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the
secrecy it deserves. Please i need you to send me your telephone number so i
can give you a call immediately for more discusion. As soon as I get your
positive response, I will send you more information to you.

Best regard

Mr. Robert Bada

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
This letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
Receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
and due to the rate of scam mails being sent around the world you 
might find it difficult to trust anyone,but please do not regrad this mail as such as i have all genuine documentsand facts backing my claims,and also a reputable security and financial institution in europe is were my funds is deposited.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction(TRANSFER), which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.

My name is HAROLD.A.MBEKI, the son of LATE STEVE ZHIRI MBEKI,
One of the most popular farmers from Zimbabwe, who was murdered in the
Land dispute in my country.As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for Contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.

Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea.

He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to
Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my
Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.

The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state 
dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to 
the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS) 
that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for
Safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase
Of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in
Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
My beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
After he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
Became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully 
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be 
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back home.You can verify my story at

1,"My Dear,
I contact you in such a surprising manner,but i respectfully insist 
that you read this mail carefully as i am optimistic that it will open 
DOORS forunimaginable financial reward for both of us. It is my pleasure 
to introduce to you a business that will make the beginning of 
never-ending family relationship. I hope that this proposal will not be an 
inconvenience or
embarrassment to you.


I must not hesitate to confide in you this simple and sincere request 
business for our mutual benefit.I am Mrs FLORENCE ACHIAH RUSANGANWA, the 
only Daughter of late Mr.Steve Achiah Rusanganwa{Snr}, a BEJA TRIBE 
MEMBER of EASTERN SUDAN in
Republic of SUDAN. I am 25 years of age. My father was a prosperous 
coffee and tin ore merchant in KHARTOUM, capital of the Republic of SUDAN 
before his untimely death. After his business trip to Abidjan - Cote 
d'Ivoire, to negotiate
on a Coffee and tin ore business he wanted to invest in Abidjan ? Cote
d'Ivoire.


A week after he came back from Abidjan, he was attacked with my mother 
by unknown assassins suspected to be Darfurian Rebels under the Sudan 
Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/M) and the Justice and Equality 
Movement(JEM) who were demanding an end to alleged economic marginalisation and 
sought power-sharing within the Sudanese state believed that my father 
has been given financial support to Beja Militia Rebels. After my 
parents death,i was aided by our church pastor,a good friend of my father 
through Chadian capital, N'Djamena to escape to ACCRA-GHANA.


But before my father gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was 
going to die,He disclosed to me that he deposited the sum of 
USD$18,500,000 (Eighteen Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) 
in cash
concealed in (2)two trunk boxes and deposited it with a private 
security house here in Accra Ghana which he declared and register as FAMILY 
VALUABLES, because of political problems here and there.


My late Father signed an agreement that the consignment should only be 
released to a foreign trustee of my choice or release it to me when i 
will become 29years old. So I want you to please assist me stand as my 
nominated foreign trustee and claim the boxes from the security company 
The money was meant for the importation of machineries for his coffee 
processing plant for a company which he wanted to establish in Abidjan ? 
Cote d'Ivoire.


Unfortunately he did not live to achieve it before he was 
gunneddown.But since I have no experience or interest in this type of business,i am 
seeking a reliable and trust worthy business partner who will assist me 
to secure,claim-out and transfer this funds abroad strictly for 
investment purposes and for guidance.


Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me to claim-out and 
transfer these 2 trunk boxes to your destination or abode, holding on my 
behalf and aid me to leave Accra-GHANA. When I join you, we can then 
invest jointly in any meaningful lucrative business in your country 
because this is my only hope in life. You shall be entitled to a significant 
portion of the fund which will be deliberated upon your acceptance to 
this offer. Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss 
the modalities of this transaction.


Only three options is waiting to effect this huge fund business.
(1)You have to come down here and confidently acompany it to your 
country.
(2)You have to volunteer any means of delivery to air lift it to your 
door step.
(3)You have to use your influence and white-personality to claim it out
and moved it to the bank for transfer to your designated account.


Please i will like you to answer me this questions.
(1)Can a black lady build house in your country and invest there?
(2)Can a black lady be given staying permit and be allowed to visit 
sight seen?
(3)Can i direct any company of my own?

My Compliment to you,

I guess this letter may come to you as a surprise since I had no  
previous correspondence with you.

I am sending you this mail on behalf of the tender board of the Niger  
Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which is in charge of managing  
and supervising the disbursement of oil sales revenues for the  
Nigerian government which covers payment to foreign and local  
contractors that have executed contracts for our country. The revenue  
under our control runs into several hundred of millions of dollars  
monthly.

We came across your contact in our search for a reliable person to  
handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of Nine  
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$9.500m). This  
fund was accrued from various over invoicing of foreign contractors'  
payments made over the years. The contract has long been executed and  
payment of the actual contract amount has been paid to the foreign  
contractor. The balance of the actual contract is what my colleagues  
and I now interested in transferring out of Nigeria into a reliable  
foreign account for our personal use.

As civil servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts. Hence we  
have chosen you to front and support us as the beneficiary to be paid.  
If you are interested in this proposal, kindly get back to me by  
sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone  
and fax numbers. For your support and partnership, please reply me to  
negotiate your fees or the percentage you wish to be paid when the  
funds are transferred into your bank account.

Further details about this transaction will be discussed in the  
subsequent correspondence. Note also that the particular nature of  
your business is irrelevant to this transaction and all local contacts  
and arrangements are in place for a smooth and successful conclusion  
of this transaction.

We will appreciate that you treat this proposal with utmost attention,  
knowing fully well that you cannot and will not be compelled to assist  
us if you are not disposed to.

I will be in UK on official assignment probably in a weeks time. I  
can be contacted via this email account drahmedsuleman@gmail.com  I  
will appreciate that you forward to me your contact telephone and fax  
numbers on responding to this mail; I will endeavour to call you for  
detailed discussion on the proposal.

Thank you as I await your response.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ahmed.

Dear Beloveth,

I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri 
Bolkiah,former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate 
on the GulfIsland.

I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family 
history,which  has already been disseminated by the international media 
during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his 
step brother,the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.

As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my 
father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion
dollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made 
my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned 
Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in 
office.

However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and 
private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later 
confiscated by the  sultanate.

Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate 
my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution 
from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that 
I 
was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a 
phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending 
you this mail.

Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five 
Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under 
special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and 
Trustee company s for safe keeping abroad.

The money where splitted and kept in the following countries in this 
proportion: US$50 Million is in Switzerland, US$100 Million is in 
London, 
US$100 Million is in United States, US$80 Million is in United Arab 
Emirate and the balance US$US170 Million is in Holland.

Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable 
investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family 
abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as 
compensation for your strong cooperation.

Please I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust 
while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion 
of this  business transaction.

I remain yours sincerely 

Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah
Brunei Darussalam.

1,"CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTD
LAGOS, NIGERIA

ATTENTION:SIR

I am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.I have resolved to contact you through this
medium based on business proposal that will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

I got your particulars through a consultant company
base on my research for atrustworthy and established
person that understands investment ethic for entering
into a life time profitable joint partnership
investment and also co-operation with confidence and
trust that you willkeep the contents secret and
divulged to any third party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited
aconsignment in our company\\'s vault for safe
keeping.And since then our client has failed to come
forward to claim his consignment, which has
accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in
demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this
client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment
had accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since
the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,
none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the
consignment with us, which means that non of his
relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment.
Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the
two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And
to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that
were registered as treasurer by our client actually
contained a considerable amount of money in United
States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million
Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing
plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and
the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot
of money from his country while he was in office as
head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment
in our vault was part of the money that our client
siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to
this money in our care.I am now soliciting your noble
assistance to assist me in transferring this money out
of nigeria to your country for immediate investment
with your assistance.I have also decided that you will
generously been titled to 30% of the total amount.
Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your
willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will
immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of
ownership of this consignment to your name to
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the
complete funds to yourcountry.
you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain
absolute confidentiality on this matter.
Please reply to the above email address with your
telephone and fax so can call you.
Thanks.
Yours faithfully.

The Presidency,Federal Government Officers

Central Bank of Nigeria and Diplomatic Corps

It is known that, many Foreigners have lost money
to Nigeria through: Fraud, Unpaid-Contract or
others. The Bank First Bank of Nigeria PLC has
been authorized to attend to all these foreign and
international matters.

The Bank is contacting you because, your email is

Ministries concerned. Only your e-mail address is
the only contact information we could retrieve for
now from the past records of Stake-Holders who have

Foreign-Affairs has been handed over to our Bank.
Please, reply this mail, so that we can proceed

approved the release of payments which has been
in this bank for many years unclaimed because my

Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have
refused to tell you the truth on how to claim your
fund this is because he has been using the interest
accumulated from your fund every year to enrich
himself without your knowledge.

I,John Aboh has been appointed by the Bank,s
Management Authority to supervise this exercise.We
are now in operation finding the rightful owners
of the funds that has accumulated in Nigeria for
years.This exercise covers all transactions ever

Dear.Md

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. 
My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.
This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.
And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  
I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. 

Best regards,

Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

Mr.David Sarr
MANAGER:ECOBANK.
DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.
Email:da_sarr@katamail.com
Tel:  +221-4488469

 Dear friend,

 I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.
 I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.
 I am contacting you concerning a customer and deposit placed under our banks management 10 years ago,i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.
 I am Mr.David Saar from Ecobank,Dakar-Senegal.Branch.This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.
 On 6th,june,1997, a Nigerian came to make a (fixed) deposit valued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in  my branch to be claimed by a foreing beneficiary to be later named,upon maturity,we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 After three years of sending reminder with no responce,we decided to open an investigation,and i was the head of the panel set up for the investigation,in the course of our investigation i finally discovered the money was Part of the loot the late Nigerian Ruler General Sani Abacha stole from Nigeria,the money was deposited under a false name. you can  confirm it yourself via the website below. 
http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnists/wickham/2002-04-19-wickham.htm.
 On further investigation, I found out that no one knows of the deposit not even his family members he died without telling any one of it.Therefore he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank as the deposit was a secret one,so i decided to keep the secret to my self as i view this as a once in a lifetime oportunity for me.
 My bank has waited for the beneficiary to come and make claims but no one has ever come forward,the reason is that he was yet to name the beneficiary before he died and i am the only one aware of this fact because i am the one in charge of the transaction. 
 This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.
 Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. 
 I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.
 We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.
 Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.
 The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business . 
 There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Please upon your approval of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:1.) The beneficiary's name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.
 I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.
 I do not find this move against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot afford to let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and I won't let it pass me by.If you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. 
 There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.
 Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:da_sarr@katamail.com or call me on my private telephone number: +221-4488469 for further discussion.
Thanks and God bless,
Mr.David Sarr

 to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate
 this search for someone to assist me.
My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to 
Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing 
trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the 
condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money

 In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be

To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through 
a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father.
 This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  
the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for 
us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our 
properties.

The money has since been deposited with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to
 you. All other information required to secure the funds will be given 
to you pending a positive response.
A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers will be highly 
appreciated.

Dear ,
Greetings to you,Please permit me to inform you of my
desire of going into business relationship with you,which
will be of a mutual benefits between both of us.
I am Mrs.Vivian Karefa,the widow of Late General John
Karefa,the former Director of military inteligence and
special acting General Manager of the Sierra-Leone Diamond
mining co-operation(SLDMC).I am contacting you to seek
your
good assistance to transfer and invest the sum of US$8.5
million (Eight Million Five hundred thousand United States
Dollars)
belonging to my late Husband which is deposited in a
fixe suspence account in a bank here in Abidjan,the
capital
city of Ivory Coast in West Africa.
This money was revenues from solid minerals and diamonds
sales which were under my husband's possession before the
civil war broke out.Following the break out of the
war,almost all government offices,co-operations and
parastatals were attacked and vandalized.
The SLDMC was looted and burnt down to ashes,and
diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the
rebels millitary forces who attacked my husband office.
Many top government officials and senior army officers
were
assasinated and my husband was a key target because of his
very sensitive military possition and appointment in the
SLDMC.
Regretably,my husband was abducted and got his two
hands amputated by the brutal R.U.F rebels(Revolutionary
United Front)during their mid-night shoot-out in our
official residence in freetown,our capital city.
Before the death of my husband in the hospital,he told me
that should incase he did not survived that he deposited
some money which he made from diamond sales and contracts
in a bankhere in Ivory Coast and that we should pray and
find a
trust worthy foreign business partner who would help us to
transfer and invest this money in profitable business
venture overseas.
He told me to do this quickly so that I can leave Ivory
Coast with my only son who is here with me in the refugee
camp and then settle down abroad.He told me where the bank
document to prove the deposit is kept in our house.
I have gone to the bank to make inquiries about this
money and I spoke with the Manager of the International
remittance who assured me that everything is intact
and promised to help me transfer this money to my
foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide my
partners foreign bank account for them.However,the
manager is very concerned because of our situation here.
If you are willing to assist me,please let me know
immediately you received this mail so that you will
arrange
the transfer of the money to your account with the
bank.Please
note that I can offer you 15% of the total sum after
the money has been transfered into your account.
I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which
you consider very good in your country.Please for security
reason,I humbly beg you to keep this transaction very
confidencial.
Please there is urgent need for the money to be
transferred to your account because of the political
crisis here in Cote d'Ivoire now.I am hoping to hear your
urgent response soonest for more clearification.
Thank you and may God richly bless you and your Dear

                                        CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"")

Compliment Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am (SALIF ZONGO),The Head of file Department in 
African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and 
reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or 
Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twelve 
million U.S.Dollars ( 12M Us$) . In an account that belongs to one of our 
foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 
2000) in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody 
is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury 
as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
business and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i 
will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages 
indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the 
money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax 
or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice 
that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any 
atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

SALIF ZONGO

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to 
move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you 
finish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well 
over this business.

 My Dear Partner,

I am Dr.Francis S. Mboma, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am
an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &
Natural Resources affiliated (created ) to the Department of Minerals and
Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty - Five
Million, Five Hundred And Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,560,000.)
which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $45.560m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your
share of the sum will be 25% of the $45.560 million, 70% for us and 5% for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on
your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel
number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.And you can also
reach me with this private email address:sonto_mbomam@epatra.com.

priviledge to hear from God and it gives me joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved instruction from God through divine revelation.I was a Moslem and a retired 
top officer in Estrada  Government  in Philippines that served under past Mr Estrada regime. I was the financial secretary to the  Estrad Ruling Council in Philippines (ERC).With my position as a financial secretary, I was able to divert up to  $15,000,000.00( Fifteen million U.S Dollars, into my personal Bank Account, hoping to invest the money when I am retired.Immediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem to Christian when I was preached the words of God 
through my cousin Pastor HANRY FRED. I then gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christain. Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.Some times I think of 
my dubious ways I diverted my countrys money into my Personal Bank Account. I then decided to seek the face of God for forgiveness and 
after fasting and prayer through Divine Revelation, the Almighty God revealed to me that the only way I could have rest of mind is when I used all my money to do the work of 
God. I immediately disclosed my revelation to my Pastor and he was happy with me.I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for my God before this present civilian 
president of my country set up a panel ( Panel) to probe the Bank Account of the past Civilan officers like me. Instead of loosing this money to my Government,I quickly 
withdrew my money out of my Account and packed it in a Trunk before i deposited it with the finance and security company as an valuable gift for safe keeping.My Pastor has adviced me to sow this money into a ministries work abroad. I have decided to sow this money into a ministry.

1,"Respectfully Greeting You,

How are you and your family? I hope all of you are fine.

This should surprise you because you don't know me and
I don't know you. Nevertheless, it is my pleasure contacting
you for the investment I intended to do in your country.

I am Sadou K. Hamal and I am 25 years of age. Though I have
not met you, considering my situation now I risk confiding in you
for my survival because I have that conviction of trusting in you.

There is this eighteen million dollar ( USd18m) my late father 
deposited in Deposit House before he was assassinated by
unspecified rebels.Unfortunately, after few months my mother
also was murdered.So, I ran away, but now, I have decided to 
invest this fund in yourcountry or anywhere safer, outside Africa 
for security and political purposes.

I want your help to transfer and invest the fund in your country,
hence I contacted you. Also I will like to continue my education
in your country, while you will manage the investment
of the fund in a good business. Then you will be getting 30% of the
profit of the investment.

I will give you further details when you reply.

My warm greetings to your family.
Respectfully Yours,
Sadou

                        (""REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
                                        CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE"")

        Compliment Of The Season,
On a very good day. I am (Prince  Hassan Esq),The Head of file Department
in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist
search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability
and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God
or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15
million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire
family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got
information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to
come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving
nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont
want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that
30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the
provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses
incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman
colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I
will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not
fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that
you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements
have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon
as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Yours
faithfully,

Prince  Hassan  (Esq.)

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer
to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you
finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very
well over this business.

1,"FROM MR ABDUL LAZEEZ
STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN
REPUBLIC OF BENIN. 
WEST AFRICA.
 
DEAR FRIEND
  I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . 
 
During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in cotonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; (http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html). 
Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One
Hundred Thousand united states dollars). 
As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. 
 
It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. 
 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. 
 
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners. 
 
Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. 
 
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. 
 
All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me. 
 
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal email address stating your wish in this deal. 
Yours faithfully, 
Mr ABDUL LAZEEZ

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. 

My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi, the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers and he has since 
been buried. 

Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die), he called me and showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe keeping with a false name. 

He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives and six children. 

I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get me at all cost.Also, I have to be very careful of my movement hence my search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your country or where it is good. 

I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you will help me and I can trust and count on you. I don't trust anybody in Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you, there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. 

You don't have to worry,as this is 100% risk free to you as only me, my dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. 

But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your response to my mail.

1,"CAN I TRUST YOU FOR THIS TRANSACTION?

Attn: The President/MD.

Sir,

My name is Mr. James Smith. I trained and work as an external auditor for
Abbey national bank - London, working as part of a bigger team that covers
 the entire Uk region. I had taken pains to find your contact through
personal endeavors.

On routine audit check last month, I discovered some US$ investment
accounts that had been dormant for the least twelve years. All the
accounts belong to a single holder with monies totaling a little above
$25.5 million United States Dollars plus interest.

Banking regulation/legislation in the Uk demands that I notify the fiscal
authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant
accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies.

The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the
following proposals.

My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in
1994 and the exact time the account was last operated. I can confirm with
certainty that the said investor died and no next of kin to his estate has
been found or has come forward all these years.

I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working
with you can secure the  funds in the account for us instead of allowing
it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Great
Britain,this is very possible. I want your participation and co-operation.

I have seized all relevant documents  (legal and Banking) that will
facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the
funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you.
Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this
transaction as the people I am working with are prepared to allocate a 20%
slice of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses.

I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I
receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.

Be assured that my colleagues and I are on top of the situation all the
time and there will be no risk whatsoever if you agree to come on board.

Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are
to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.
To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to
a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details.

To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by
email smith533@sify.com or jamessmith1952@yahoo.co.uk stating your full
name, date of birth, direct mobile telephone number, fax number and email
address.

I do expect you prompt response.

Thank you,

Mr. James Smith.

UNION BANK PLC.

My name is Bello Ali the manager, credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1998.

Since the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.

And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
The deceased. 

When you receive this letter. Kindly, send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication.
Awaiting your favorable response.

West Africa.

Hello Dear Chosen one, 
Please excuse me for all the inconveniences my mail could cause you.I 
saw your profile and have the intrest on you . Please  even if we never 
knew before, I believe firmly that on the basis of the right of 
humanitarian assistance that a real confidence and love can arise from 
our communication and  also a real partnership between  us. 

I am Miss Medine ZACHI , the legitimate daughter of the Director of 
cocoa export here murdered by the rebelles here because of the 
political crisis going on here since four years ago. 

My father had deposited a consignment  with a  security company here  
containing the sum of  $9.000,000 USD (Nine million dollars USD) To 
allow him to conceive a project of investment at the end of his mandate 
here. 

Regrettably the fate decided on it otherwise. 

Today my major concern  is to move out  this sum outside here. Given 
that I am the only child and I have seriously suffered from the 
raggings and the harassments on behalf of the political opponents of my 
Father.

It is in this prospect that I contact you  to please help me  to move 
this heritage  from the security company to your country.

Because of the political war and the hostilities in this country  I 
seriously wish to leave from here and  live the rest of my life in a 
more peaceful and politically more stable and quiet country. It is  
what justifies  this demand. 

I shall voluntarily agree on a good and appropriate percentage of this 
money as your compensation for your assistant as for what precedes. 

I would like to count on your human, virtuous and professional 
qualities. 
I look forward to recive your urgent responds.
Thanks for your care .

1,"Dearest in the Lord, 

Greetings to you and your family, I am Mrs ELIZABETH 
LAMINE  from liberia. I am married to Mr. Mike LAMINE who worked with liberia embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2004.He is also a well known fruits import and Export business man in Ivory Coast. We were married for eleven years without a child.
 
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.6Million US dollars with a bank in Ivory Coast Presently, this money is still in the custody of the bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. 

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or better to an individual personality that have a humanity understanding and trustworthy that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or an individual personality that  is trustworthy  to use this money for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained.
 
The Bible made us to understand that ""Blessed is the hand that giveth"". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace"". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. 

I don't want them to know about this development as I am convinced that With God by my said, all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Ivory Coast, I will also send a copy of my passport to you and my photo and also issue you an authority letter that will empower you to be the beneficiary of the money. I want you and your church to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd and he shall see us through, My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian so I have no fear at all for I am convinced that God is with me and he shall be with you if you make yourself available to take up this spiritual project of God. 

I believe that whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth thus I took this decision. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on this email  via elizabeth_lamine2004@yahoo.co.uk always and please be informed that any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. 

Hoping to receive your reply. 
Remain blessed in the Lord. 
Yours in Christ, 
MRS LIZABETH LAMINE

Soneri Bank Limited

Britto Road, Garden East, 
Karachi,pakistan



Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Zakir Mehmood official of Soneri Bank Limited .This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition.

On June 6, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the pakistan 
Asian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.kassim Hassan made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00,(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address,but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.kassim Hassan died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that   Mr.kassim Hassan
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safe keeping.

No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Asian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, 
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to 
stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account.

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for 
me and 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our 
communication can only be via email and fax mostly.


Thanks and my regards.

Zakir Mehmood.

Dear sir,

I am MR, TEMA WILLIAMS, the son of late
MR.PATRICK WILLIAMS, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable & compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law
does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk
free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.
Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance. Please funish me your private
phone and Fax number for easy and better communication.
Remember that this is highly confidential and the
success of this business depends on how secret it is kept.
PLEASE KINDLY REPLY TO : temawilliams172@webmail.co.za

Expecting your reply soonest.

1,"Dear Friend,

In a brief, I am Mrs Jessica Haword, Wife of late Mr Jackson Haword, a
white farmer, murdered by unknown assailants in the year 2003 in Zimbabwe.

My husband was a great white farmer in Zimbabwe who was brutally murdered
in the land dispute in Zimbabwe by the agents of the ruling government of
President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy forthe opposition
MDC PARTY led by the minority white farmers. My husband was among the few white
rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the war veterans backed by the
government.Before the death of my husband, he deposit the sum of US$8.5M 
(Eight Million Five hundred thousand United State Dollars) with one of the
Financial Institution, as if he knew the looming danger in ZIMBABWE. We were
married for twelve years and God blessed us with twin?s children.

Presently this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, my
Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an
inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive
care,in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living
like this.

I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a
charity organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children.
I want an individual, or a Charity Organisation that will use this fund for
orphanages, widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

I took this decision because my husband's relatives are Trouble Makers and
I don't want my husband's efforts to be used for trivialities I do not want a
situation where my husband's sweat will be used in material pursuits.
This is why I am taking this decision.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my
lawyer,telephone number and email address who will issue you a letter of
authority that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.

Please ensure to contact me with this email:(jessica_haword@sms@.cz) to enable
me direct you to my lawyer.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for
this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein.

Hope to receive your reply.

Remain blessed.

Your Sister,

Mrs Jessica Haword.

1,"Compliments.

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a
hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer to an
oversea account ($16,700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Dakar Senegal. I
want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank
account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even
an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain
honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you
and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am Mr Philip Tarila. a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner.
During the course of his bank's last week auditing,it was discovered that
since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So the
bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This
account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated
on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I
discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money
is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate
who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde
which crahsed on July 25th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next
of kin.
No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that the account is a secret account.

The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars only [$16, 700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money
into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the
account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am
revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total
amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might
have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your
earliest reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.reply to (

[HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL]
[TRANSFER OF [THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN
 
HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS]

TRANSFER OF 
36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. My name is Dr.Andrew 
William, and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank 
here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important 
business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I 
choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest 
medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and 
private, and it should be treated as such.

Atfirst I will like to 
assure you  that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both 
parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. 
THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS 
A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his eath,The Late Prime Minister, 
Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and 
all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his 
account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The 
family do not know about this deposit.

I was on a routine inspection 
that I dscovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY 
SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on 
further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to theaccount. The 
bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former 
operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody 
will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim 
this money with legal claims to the account Holder, therefore I need 
your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary 
information needed in order to claim this money, Hoping in God that you 
will never let me down now and in future.o.k!

Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri 
(November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, 
was a Lebanese self-made illionaire and business tycoon, and was five 
times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his 
last resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri 
died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg 
of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel 
i n theLebanese capital, for more information please log on to (http:
//www.hariri.info) I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW 
THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW 
OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND 
GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Let me hear from you URGENTLY by Email.

Best 
Regards
Dr. Andrew William

Dear Friend,

Greetings to you.

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both 
of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to 
make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left 
with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my 
client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that 
he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an 
Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this 
from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.

WEBSITE.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.

I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.
According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to 
the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years 
of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is 
to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the 
legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his 
next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great 
confidence in me.

Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you 
and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami 
victims,
as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a 
codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.

Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for 
you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.
This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of 
getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity 
so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of 
the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the 
sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its 
confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with 
anybody, even if you decline my request.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly

Stephen Ayling.

1,"Dear Sir,I am Mr.Eric Madu,  I got your contact through a friend who attended a trade mission in your country, but I did not disclose the nature of the business to him. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Charles Fredrick with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,000.00(Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:www.thestate.com/mld/state/4904572.htm on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL,and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Fredrick did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$20,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest isbeing rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Fredrick so that the fruit of this  old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple,I will like you to provide immediately your fullname and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction.

RE: TRANSFER OF US$48.223 MILLION{FORTY EIGHT MILLION
TWO HUNDRED & TWENTY THREE THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS ONLY}
TO YOUR ACCOUNT. [STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL] 

I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important
business having gone through your remarkable profile
on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has
been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it
because it still remains the fastest medium of
communication. However, this correspondence is
unofficial and private, and it should be treated as
such.

At first I will like to assure you that this
transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both
parties.

My name is Dr.Kazim Loch,I work as the
operational manager in account management section in
charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime
banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a
Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million two
hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On
further discreet investigation, I also discovered that
the account holder has died long ago with his family
on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the
account and no other person knows about this account.
I am in close contact with the manager of the bank
here who is my partner and he is willing to approve
the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner
with foreign bank account because the former operator
of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in
particular.  I am certainly sure that he has no
written or oral WILL attached to the account , no
beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim
of this money. 

It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with
legal claims to the account holder which I will
provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need
your cooperation in this transaction. The difference
in country of origins is not a hindrance to the
success of this transaction. This money will remain
useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer
the fund out to a foreign account.
I will provide the necessary information and documents
needed in order to claim this money. I only need your
cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank
account information for the transfer. All arrangement
that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the
account which you are to nominate is already in
place.You should also provide me with your direct
phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost
confidentiality in handling this transaction. 

At the conclussion of this transaction, your share
will be 25% of the total transfer sum, 70% for me and
my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses
both parties might incure during the process of the
transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account
in two parts. I will first transfer USD $20 Million to
your account. I will fly over to meet you after the
successful transfer for sharing according to the
agreed percentages. I will  have the remaining balance
of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account only
after the successful sharing of the first transfer
without any disappointment from your side.

Have a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your
hands. Let me hear from you Urgently.
Best Regards, 
Dr.Kazim Loch.

1,"VERY URGENT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.


PLEASE I WANT YOU TO RELPY ME THIS MAIL TO MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESSES vinobi@voila.fr and applefamily@indiatimes.com


Dear Sir, 


I am MR. MOHAMMED ABACHA the son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, former head of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the death of my father the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been tormenting members of the Abachas family including family friends. All businesses and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by the Government and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been frozen. A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody,  the government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I was only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor.


During the reign of my father as the president of this country, an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revealed. The contract was for the construction of plant, at Ikuta Abasi in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria, for production of ingots and billets required as raw material for Aluminum and Allied Industries, Reynolds Incorporated of America, Phoenix and M&F Companies of Switzerland conducted the feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany. However, after the revaluation of the contract, Ferrostall AG collected its own share of the increment in project cost, while my father's share of fifty-eight Million U.S. Dollars (US$58,000,000:00) was deposited on my name with a security company here in Nigeria for safety keep and I know that my father was planning of how to send this money abroad before his sudden death in June 8 1998. Since then the money has been with the security company up till date. This US$58M was secretly packaged in a trunk box and the certificate of deposit where on my name and is still in my possession.


Hence all plane is to ship this money abroad through a diplomatic means without the knowledge of anybody from outside knowing my involvement in this money, to avoid be seized due to my presently situation and also I am handicapped as what next to do since I am not conversant with international monitory policies. Hence I am contacting you as a reputable and trustworthy person, with a well experience and able hand to help. This was to bit the security system in Nigeria Because I want you to claim the money on my behalf. I have declared to the security company that the consignment belongs to (YOU) as my foreign business partners.  Actually I got your contact from a reliable source, and also I believe you are in a good position to assist me to transfer this fund for good investment.


Upon receipt of your willingness to assist me claim this money I will then contact my personal attorney to draft a power of attorney that will authorise you as the beneficially of this money so that you can handle this transaction on my behalf. And as soon as this money leaves Nigeria I will travel out to seek asylum either in Europe or America.My contract with APEX FINANCE AND SECURITIES GROUP remains few weeks to expire and I am down broke to renew the duration with the Security Company.
 
As a matter of urgency, I will like you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number. I shall send you all the clearance documents by fax. I will then forward your name as the beneficiary and my foreign business partner to the Security Company. 
 
You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum involved for your assistance, 5% will be set aside for reimbursement to you for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.


Your URGENT response is needed. I want you to call my Attorney Mr Lawrence Daniel on 234 1 7765468 for more detailed directives infomations and the nest requied step of how we have to make move immidiately as i have told him about you and he is to handle all the processing with you on my behalf.  All your REPLY must go through these our family private email address: vinobi@voila.fr and applefamily@indiatimes.com, I will also need your private and direct telephone and fax number for easy reach.


Please this is a very confidential matter, you don't disclose to anybody for us to have success.

                        BUSINESS PROPOSAL


 My name is DR.JERRY M AHMED   a member of the 
Presidential Task Force on
Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last yearthere was a
major oil spillage in
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over
70% of the
communities homeless.The contract was handled by a
foreign firm but
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged, we
decided to
over-invoice the contract
sum. Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has
since been paid,but the contract balance of US$31.50
million(THIRTY-ONE
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES
DOLLARS),which resulted from
the over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a
suspense account
with the CENTRAL BANK of NIGERIA,is what me and my
partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem
is as government
officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank
accounts,talk less of having
foreign ones.

To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a
foreign partner who
can assist us and receive this amount into your
account. We are ready to
share this money with you on the basis of
participation. We also have
plans to invest part of this money in any viable
business in your country
under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age.

In any case, I received a reference of
you/organization from the Nigeria
Chambers of Commerce and Industry 'Foreign Trade
Division' as a reputable
organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please
if you accept my
proposal do not hesitate to send me a send me an
e-mail  so that I can
provide you with the basic procedures for the release
of the fund.

It does not matter whether you or your company does
contract project of
the nature described here, the assumption is that you
won a major contract
and subcontracted it to another company, more often
thannot, big trading
companies or individuals of unrelated field win major
contracts here in
Nigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized
firms for execution.

 BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall
remit this money, you
will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will
be for me and my
partners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any
expenses that may be
incurred by both parties during this transaction, both
local and
international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with
utmost degree of
maturity and confidentiality because I am still in
active government
service with the""NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM
CORPORATION"". If I receive
your response on time, this whole transaction could be
accomplished within
the shortest possible time based on your interest and
determination,since the money is already in transit.

Awaiting your urgent response and thanks for your
anticipated co operation

Yours faithfully,

Dr.JERRY M AHMED

Dear Sir,

Compliments Of The Day, Permit me to introduce myself
to you. My name is DR Andrew Godson,a top Management
Official of  the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,
Benin Republic.

I came to know about you in my private search for a
reliable person/company to handle an important
assingment on behalf of my Colleagues and myself.

PROPOSITION: An Australian Engr Donald Pepper, a
prosperous Oil/Gold merchant had in our Bank the sum
of $28.5million in a domiciliary account.
Unfortunately, he was killed in a ghastly motor
accident in Benin Republic in 2001. Efforts had been made by
the management of my bank through the Australian
Embassy to contact any of the deceased children but to
no avail.
We later discovered that he had no children.Given the
skeletal information available to the bank,it has so
far been impossible to reach any of the relatives.

The situation left for the Management is to declare
the deceased account dormant and revert the funds to
trading for interest to the Bank. In order to avoid
this development, my Colleagues and I now seek your
approval to have you stand as a distant relative to
Engr Donald Pepper,so that the money would be released
to you.

All documents and proofs to enable you get the money
will be carefully packaged once we receive your
consent on this proposal.I shall apply for a leave as
soon as the funds get into your reliable account to
come to your country for sharing and investments which
you will assist me in doing.
May I assure you that this is safe and risk-free, as
we have taken care of all necessary modalities to
ensure a hitch-free movement. I have the authority of
my partners involved in this assignment to propose
that should you be willing to assist us in this,your
share would be 25%.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me.

Best Regards,
DR Andrew Godson.

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation;  and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together, so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response. You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.

1,"Dear Sir/Madam
Compliment of the day to you .
I got your contact through a friend, who attended a programme in 2005,S.P.E.
Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, in searching for a reliable and
trust worthy person to handle risk free transaction.He recommended you to me.

I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch
. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th
2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek
made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at
TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next
of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.
This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will come forward to claim it.
According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies
to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to
assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael
creek,
 so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the
hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favor for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous
expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary
paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.
Best Regards.
Mr.Mustapha Momodu  "

GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST BANK.
RUE CLUB DE L' AMITIE,
0251 B.P. 1625 COTONOU,
BéNIN REPUBLIQUE.



My Dear Friend,

  In Oder to transfer to overseas $28.5 million(USD)
from GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST BANK,Bénin Republique.
I want to  ask you to quietly look for a reliable
and honest person who will be capable and fit to
provide either an existing bank account or to set up a
new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even
an empty a/c can serve to receive this funds quitely.

I am Mr.Daniel Mensah, the accountant/auditor of
the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,Bénin
Republique and personal confidant to Mr.Alvaro Quesada
of Dominican Republic in Caribbean Island who died in
a Plane Crash accident(2002-04-19) on his way to
attend a weddind ceremony together with his wife and
only Child (Alvaro Jr).

Mr.Alvaro Quesada, is From Dominican Republic in
Caribbean Island, and a prosperous Tobacco merchant,
he died in the year 2002 without having any
beneficiary to his assets including his account
here in Bénin which he opened in the above stated bank
in the year 2001 as his personal savings for the
purpose of expansion and developement of his company
in Africa before his untimely death in 2002.Until his
death,he was the president of the Dominican Tobacco
Exporters Association.

And from my Investigation,i found out that No other
person knows about this account because he( Mr.Alvaro
Quesada )never knew that he is going to die so soon,
and so his purpose was not achieved. If i don't remit
this money immediately, it will get lost(may be it
will go into the pockets of the corrupt government
officials who will never use it for any reasonable
thing at all).I dont want to miss this opportunity
because it comes ones in a life time.

The amount involved is $28.5 million(USD)Twenty eight
million,five hundred United States Dollars and no
other person knows about this account. I am contacting
you for us to transfer this funds to your account as
the beneficiary,I want to first transfer
$16,000.000.00(Sixteen million USD) from this money
into a safe account abroad, after which we will
transfer the remaining (12.5M).  I am only contacting
you as a foreigner because this money cannot be
approved to a local person here, without a valid
foreign international  passport, but can only be
approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c, this is
because the money is in US Dollars and the former
owner of the a/c, Alvaro Quesada is a foreigner too,
and as such the money can only be approved into a
foreign a/c.

However,  I am revealing this to you with belief in
God that you will never let me down in this business.I
don't know you and have never seen you before,i only
got your contacts from an international directory
which my secretary provided for me. You are the first
and the only person that I am contacting for this
business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take. Send also your
private telephone and fax number.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account,which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a keybank
official who is deeply involved with me in this
business.
I want to tell you that this transaction is 100% risk
free and legal because all the documents that will
back up this transaction will be available, so that no
body will question the fund when it is finaly
tranfered to your account.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
40% of the total amount and 60% will be for me. I look
forward to your earliest reply through this email.


Thanks for your time.

Your's faithfully,

Mr.Daniel Mensah

 Compliment of the day, I am JAMES KYARI, The son of late General  Kubwa Kyari of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
 Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  of our
numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was able to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to  the Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that
will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  clearthis money is with a finance security company in Holland.
 On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised
that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.
 I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in Belgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the totalsum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the courseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and  my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.
 Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your account for security reasons.
 This is my e-mail address you can reach  me:(jameskyari22@netscape.net

ATTENTION PLEASE,

I AM DR IDRIS  ALI, THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. WITH DUE RESPECT AND REGARD. I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION .

DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.

THE SAID AMOUNT WAS U.S 7.5M (SEVEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE INFORMATION THROUGH INTERNET DIRECTORY . MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST, AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND INTERNET BILLS, WHILE 60% WILL BE FOR ME AND MY COLEAGUES. PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP ""TOP SECRET"" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.

I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL NFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU.

I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVE YOUR PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR EASY

I ascetained your contact through a reliable source,In
my search for a foreign partner to assist me in my
business. 
I am William Drallo, the son of  late former Minister
Of Mines and Natural Resource during the time of Major
Koromah, the former Military Head of State of the
Republic of  Sierra Leone, who was massacred by
president Tijani Kabba force in their struggle to
reinstate him back to power.

I and my brother are refugee here in Accra,Ghana since
the death of our father, because of  the  condition of
his death.Before the death of my  father some months
ago he disclosed to me some money and gold he had
deposited in a security company here in ghana. 

The total amount of money which happened to
be$28.3000.000.oo,US Dollars.And gold at 200Kg of
22Karat all in a security vault in ghana.

The document regarding this consignment was handed
over to me by my father before his death, I carefully
search and found the security Company where I
confirmed that the consignment were deposited for safe
keeping in their securit vault in ghana.

The content were deposited as a family valuable, By
virtue of right as the son of my late father, the
security company has accepted to release the
consignment factually.

I am seeking your assistance because my father has
declared the record with the security company stating
that his foreign parrtner shall be the authorised
person to make claim on this consignment becaues of
his position in government on which no name was given
by my father as his foreign partner.

To this effect, I request to make the beneficiary of
his consignment in your name as foreign partner to
claim this consignment. For your assistance,I am ready
to give you 10%from the total sum.  This is a risk
free transaction
as my father deposited this valuable as a personal
belonging.
In this situation every process to completely move
this  valuable may not exceed (7) working days, if
your co-operation to assist is sort.please include
your phone and fax number for easy communication I
shall be very
grateful to hear from you, all documents concerning
this are intact with me, please kindly reach me as

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANEGER ,
BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA.


Dear Friend,

I am the manager of billing and exchange at the
foreign remittance department of BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA here in Madrid Spain. In my department. we discovered an abandoned sum of ??m euros (FOURTY Million
euros) in an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer (MR. Rudi Fassnacht from Cologne, Germany) who died along with his entire family in Jully 2000 in a
plane crash.For more informations about the crash you
can visit this site:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless some body
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and
laws but unfortunately we
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving
nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I now decided to make this business
proposal to you and release the money to you as the
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it
and we don't want this money to go into the Spanish
treasury government account as unclaimed funds.

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after five years, the
money will be transfered into the government treasury
account as unclaimed funds. The request of foreigner
as next of kin
in this business is occassioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and a Spanish cannot stand as
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a
respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%
will be set aside for expenses incurred during the
business and 60% will be invested in any lucrative
business of your choice and as soon as this is done, i
will resign from my work and join you immediatelly.
Remmember that the trust leed upon you is based on
mutual business understanding and a life time
opportunity which i believe you will not allow it go.

To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you
as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as
relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of
application 
that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to
me your private telephone and fax number for easy and
effective communication and location where the money
will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application . I will not fail
to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as
All required arrangements have been made for the
transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as
you receive this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.send all
correspondence by email don_hosenando@yahoo.com for
security reasons

Yours Faithfully,

DON HOSE NANDO

Am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I 
believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in 
you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before. 
You can find the story on this 
website:http://(news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm) 
On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the 
city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the 
President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some 
fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our 
security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building 
and took my father away to an un-known destination. 
After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, 
by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in 
the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by 
hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can 
not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was 
because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that 
he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. 
And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for 
conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he 
deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million 
five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank he also told my 
mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is 
made for investment purpose in the western world. 
That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of 
the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now.for 
refugee camp I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy 
to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and 
my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for 
your assistance . 
Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so 
that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being 
kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact us through our 
alternate email adress. 
Am waiting for your response. 
Thanks and God bless. you

Dear Friend In Christ,
 
I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life.
 
My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed.
 
My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster.
 
My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you.
 
Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me.
 
I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing.
 
As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly.
 
I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today.
 
Please reply this mail immediately if you have the love and care of God at: help.ed_brown@yahoo.co.uk
 
Thank you.

"
1,"Dear Sir/Madam

At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving
this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that,
I am constrained to write you this letter because of
the urgency of it. 

By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr.
Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position
in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award
SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national
identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were
then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.

Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues
so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock
during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his
case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough
to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.


However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and
untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because
I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my
late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs
to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger
brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken
all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses
and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United
States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but
again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling
document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in
obnoxious custom and traditional norms.
 
Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company
in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one
Security company in Europe. It has therefore become
very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help
me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably
an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf
as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.
These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection,
seizure or diversion.
 
I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company
in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's
demands.

This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving
these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance
that you will not divert the fund if you help me. 
 
My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is
all my children and I have got to live on. 
 
Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint
me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile
No and also your fax no for easier communication.
The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely
kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help
me.

Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from
you.

Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

I have traveled along side with the Minister of Petroleum to your country in search of investors that would be interested to invest on our Petroleum Sector, it was in one of this trip that I was opportune to realize that the trips been made by the Minister is not for the search for an investor but for the search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan petroleum sector that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this discovery, but I later realized that I was the only one among other top staffs that was not aware of these happenings, investigation into this matter made me to know that even the president is involved.

about where I got your contact address. I got your

During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe
from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to
claim all the white-owned farms to his party members
and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to
surrender all their farms to his party members and his
followers. 
My father is one of the best farmers in our country
and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,
Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt
everything in t! he farm, killing my father and made
away with a lot of items in my father' s farm. 
Before his death, my father had deposited with one of
the Security Company in dakar senegal sum of US$12.5 
Million Dollars(Twelve million fivehundred Thousand 
united state Dollars). After thedeath of my father, 
we decided to move to the Republic of senegal dakar where 
he had deposited the money inthe Security Company as 
valuables.

So I decided to contact overseas firm and companiesa

Dear Friend,
                              ASSISTANCE

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the son
of the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire)
Mr.Laurent Desire Kabila.

I am contacting you in other to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.

Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without
any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.

Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.

I have the sum of USD20.7Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to Security reasons, as
my narration below will explain.

But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has
been calculated as 15% of the total sum of USD$20.7M, 5% for expenses and the
rest for my family and I.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having
married to so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My
step brother Joseph, who is currently the  president of my country, is the son
of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.

Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my late father left behind for the entire family.

Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late
father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your
assistance to help us receive this money overseas for proper investment.

Let me quickly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because the
diamond sales are packaged from  the unset in a pattern that shows no direct
trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is deposited and
is secured with a holding company under deposit account.

I am waiting for your swift and favourable response, and in case you have any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.

My alternative e mail address is : gkabila@hispavista.com

Best Regards.


George Kabila.

It is with trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the transfer of US$35Million Dollars.
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to an International Oil Firm, to Service, Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Plant in Nigeria. This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior colleagues) to the tune of (US$35 Million United State Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested

We want you to present yourself as the Beneficiary to this fund, so that we can release the fund into your account for safety and subsequent disbursement. We have all modalities set.
We have been disappointed some years ago by a British, Mr. Rick Williams whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of US$50Million U.S. Dollars. He is sitting on our money for no apparent reason and refused to give us our share but we believe that for his act of wickedness to us, he will never go unpunished by God. Mr. Rick Williams still resides in London and enjoying our collective money.Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight-forward person. 
As, we are willing to try again with you believing in your good 
cooperation and Faithfullness.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 30% for the account owner (you).
2. 60% for me and my partners

Dear  Sir,  
Kindly Pardon me if this my letter would be an embarrassment to you for I am Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed, a Sudanese from the town of Kass in Southern Darfur writing you from Birmingham,  (United Kingdom), I am presently a Political Refugee in United Kingdom away from my native Country (Sudan), where there is a raging and devastating Civil war going on between the Southern Sudan Rebel Forces (Sudan People's Liberation Army) and Arab militias (Janjaweed)  supported by the Government Forces loyal of President Umar Hassan al-Bashir. Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989. 
The Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million, most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for ""internally displaced people,"" and some crossing the border into Chad, where they live in refugee camps, straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes, killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees who have been impoverished, battered and displaced by years of Civil war in our lands. 
I am therefore using this medium to solicit for your assistance. Your contacts were obtained  by me during my search on the Internet for a reliable person that would assist us in claiming this money from the Secret Vault of a Financial Institution where it was deposited in a friendly Country  through the help of a sympathetic Senior Nurse attached to the Red Cross International Society some time ago, though the Nurse is late now as she died of Typhoid fever shortly after but there is a particular Financial Agent who would assist you in  claiming the money and using part of it to buy foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothing etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees. 

I would send copy of a POWER OF ATTORNEY given to me by the Late Commander which I would send alongside copies of my INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT and a second Power of Attorney to you that would enable you claim the funds from the Financial Institution upon your agreement and readiness to assist us. 

I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the TOP SECRECY this transaction requires, as I expect your positive response through this above Email address as my movement is presently restricted by law covering Political Refugees, though I might give you a telephone number later where you can talk with me. On receiving your positive response we hope to finish this transaction within one week as a lot of our people are dying from sicknesses, diseases and hunger.

Expecting  your URGENT Positive response and thanks in advance.

Yours  Sincerely,
Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed

P/S. If you are not interested in assisting us, we beg you to destroy this letter so that it does not fall into wrong hands.

Hello Dear.
Compliments of the season. I am Mrs. Linda johnson, a civil servant from Zimbabwe. I got your contact from Chamber and Commerce office as I was searching for someone who will help me out of my present predicament,My late husband, Mr.Icheke Johnson was the co-owner of an Agricultural firm and his partner happens to be among the white farmers that the dictator President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe took over their farmlands and handed over to the blacks, despite all the pleas from the International Community, and members of the commonwealth country's Most of the company's assets, animal farms and milk industry were seized and confiscated by the tyrant President. 

My late husband was a British citizen of African descent and we both lived in the company's staff quarters but our lives were threatened by agents of President Mugabe. Since then, my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. A substantial amount of money was deposited in the finance house by my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff, because President Mugabe, placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough, I and my late husband along with some other farmers were assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad. 

The total Sum is THIRTY SIX million US dollars (US$36.000.000.), the money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father, from whom we took over the family business. The money arrived safely in Europe. All the documents to the deposition of the money are with me here in Senegal and with the Bank also for Security reasons. I would like you to assist me to relocate the money to your country into any account of your choice or keep it for me in your safe custody until I am able to come to your country after my operation soon. I would like to invest the money into any lucrative business, you deem profitable and your assistance is highly needed in the areas of investment feasibility studies. 

Hence I need your cooperation to secure this deposit which is as it stands now, the only hope of my survival as I have already lost my husband, coupled with my sickness and the situation of insecurity. Life is no more the same with me after all the lot I have gone through. Moreover, I wouldn't mind paying you any amount you will charge me up to 20% of the total money for your assistance in relocating and keeping the money for me as well as helping me to carry out proper investment. You keep 80% for me pending execution of the investment. 
As a sick person, it will be difficult to handle this alone, hence I need your immense help, coupled with your distinguished business acumen and track record. Please, I would like you to come to my assistance, I am a lonely widow and in utter confusion and distress. 
This business is solely between two of us and should there be any need for a third party, I will contact one of the Red Cross staff with whom I have established some trust. I am scared that if any one gets to know about this, he might take advantage of my helpless situation. to diverted this fund or seat on the money without helping me to manage it as planed, so please if your willing to help kindly contact me very urgently, 
Sincerely your's,

Mrs. Linda Johnson.

Dear Friend, 

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have 
not met, permit me however, I am MR. SIMON RENAUD, a white Zimbabwean 
Farmer, the owner of Diary farms limited in Zimbabwe. I own three 
tobacco farms in Chipinge, and I am also majority owner of Glen Devon 
Farm also situated in Chipinge, in Zimbabwe. I am contacting you as

become necessary due to our plans to relocate to that country so that 
I can purchase some lands and start farming all over again as the 
present political instability in Zimbabwe, does not encourage 




"
1,"Dear Sir/Madam.

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr.Dougan .O.Oyony ,The son of the paramount 
late chief Moussambani.D. Oyony, of Litoral Province (Bata) in Equatorial Guinea.In African continent we are one of the smallest population in westren Africa, our natural resources is petroleum, natural gas, timber, gold, bauxite, diamonds, tantalum, sand and gravel,Guinea is the Oil and Diamond Richer in Africa, following by Angola and Sierra Leone and others Africa country.
My late father, his royal highness, chief Moussambani.D. Oyony, the 3rd oversaw the land redistribution and allocation of land, which has been ongoing since five years; and until his death, successfully allocated land for private, corporate as well as local individually for wide ranging uses which includes, farming, industry and manning.

However due to his untimely death in February 20th 2005, the process of land allocation has been other slow parcel.
The clout and influence my late father wielded in wooing potential investors to own community has suffered greatly due to his demise. By culture and tradition; I have to inherit the vacant chieftaincy title and 
other responsibilities that goes with it, but there must be a mourning period of one year following his death before I can assume the reigns. The proposal however is multifaceted; firstly, I have to kick start the other nonbound programmer of land allocation determine the suitability of interested applicants etc.
Our community is rich in minerals such as gold and platinum and rough diamonds. Presently, there are three unused mines totally under my control which has been confirmed to hold great deposits of gold and 
platinum. 
I wish to go into business with foreign partners who would obviously play great roles in extracting those minerals presently, I have in my possessions a very significant amount of diamond (uncut) gold and platinum which are available for inspection and verification; but I greatly 
solidify a trusted foreign partner who can help in transporting these minerals with great discretion for our mutual benefits, to countries overseas.
Hence my decision to send you this letter with intention, trusting that you would see the great business opportunities there in; however due to the sensitive nature and scrutinous controls with these precious 
metals, I am trusting that this transaction would be treated with utmost confidentiality between us.
For more details and precise information regarding how this deal can be exploited, you may contact me on this e mail+ moussambani2@webmail.co.za, 
And I shall forward to you important documents regarding all I said in this letter.

I shall await your response as I urge you to seriously and urgently consider this request .Here is thanking you very much for your time.


Yours sincerely,

Hello,

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense 
benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that 
we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when 
we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am 
presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his 
next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died 
on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with 
other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below 
which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.

 WEBSITE.
http://news.bbc.co.
uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm
 
I am now faced with confusion of 
who to pass the fortune to.
According to the English law, the fortune 
is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward 
as the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of 
the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the 
beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, 
which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I 
alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.

Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for 
you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the 
tsunami victims,
as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is 
amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the 
$7million legacy.

Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider 
this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are 
documents to back it up. 
This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-
kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I 
prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being 
disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the 
English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this 
issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I 
therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if 
you decline my request.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly

Paul Spencer.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER,

OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.

Dear Friend,



I am the AUDITIING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) here in Ouagadougou,Burkina Faso.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$15.5m(Fifteen million Five hundred thousand united states dollars).in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer(MR.ARTHUR BILLINGS from AMERICA,USA)who died along with his entire family in Monday,31 July,2000,in a plane crash.FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOW:
 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm



Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unlessn some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.



It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this businessproposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.



The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me hereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of application .



I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this 
letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.

The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

PHONE  002377898587
FAX        002373361683

Greetings,

In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable 
source and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am 
John Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President 
Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. 

;I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly have to 
solicit your attention to this assistance and foreingn investment. I write 
this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of  US $ 20 000,000.00
 with you. I inherited this funds from my mother. This funds was generated 
through the sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege 
position to engage in the business of Diamond and timber since she knows
 that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the 
privilege situation.
When my father was assassinated on 16th January 01 by one of his 
bodyguards Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some Top Army 
officers that wanted to topple his government, I escaped to Cameroon 
because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph 
Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are 
not in the best of relationship because of tussle for who among them 
will be the first lady and this ultimately affected us their children.

Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave for 
Cameroon for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a 
security Company.

On getting to cameroon where I have been living since then 
 I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me 
in moving this funds out for safe banking and profitable foreighn 
investment. 
Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this funds in 
Cameroon nor Africa due to my status in my country as a result of my 
fathers death.
.And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this funds is all that I and my 
mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father's
assets and funds and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing 
that this funds was deposited at the security company. so this is why I 
decided that investing this funds abroad should be the best safest typy 
of adventure for me. I will be honoured if I can be given the privilege of 
investing this fund through your help.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough 
to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a 
hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your 
sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total fund and annual 
5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. 
Thereafter, the terms shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise 
during this transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive,When the fund 
($20,000,000.00) is moved into your discrete account, you will be 
allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 75% will be invested 
meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and 
deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends 
yeilding.
Should you for any reason not interested,please kindly reach me so as to
 make other contacts and please try  to keep this letter tight secret for the 
interest of my family.

Best regards.

1,"Dear Rrrrr,
Before I introduce my self, i will like to tell you the reason why i needed your assistance in this matter.
  I had to contact you since your last name coincide with that of our late customer last name which is appropriate for this,i hope and pray to God that i have the right and trusted person.
  I am a Manager in a bank here in Africa. 
  I have been working in this bank since 1989,i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you, in January 2001, an American oil consultant /contractor(ENGR.Frank Rrrrr) made a numbered-time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months in a Domiciliary Account in my Branch running into a very large sum of money, At the time of opening this account, he did not name a next of kin promising to do so in his next visit to Africa.
  He never came back and nobody heard from him.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification of Account Status to his forwarding address but got no reply. In february 2005, i sent a reminder of same letter and finally i discovered from his contact employers that Engr.Frank , died in an Auto Crash.After further investigation in Oct 2006, I found out that he did not leave a ""WILL"" and all attempts to trace his Next-of-kin were fruitless.
  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the late Engr.Frank , did not declare any Next-of-Kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit Papers. 
  This sum of $24Million Dollars, is still floating in our Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one would come forward to claim it.
  According to the local Laws, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to our Bank Managerment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently upon the above, my request is that I would like you to stand in as the Next-of-kin to the late Engr. Frank Rrrrr,since your last name is the same with our late customer, i would document you in our records here as the next of kin to the man so that you can make claims to the deposit. 
  With me here your claims will be approved without any delay and the funds will be transferred to your nominated bank account. 
  Though we need to discuss in detail as to our participation and modalities. Be assured that i am in charge and there will be no problem but I'll not fail to beg you to observe religiously the high level of secrecy required in this deal for us to succeed.
  Please I await your urgent response. 
  Regards,
Mr.John Bello

Dear sir/madam
 
I am Laurence Jerry, a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.Robert Norton who used to work with  Gas Investing  in Abidjan (COTE D IVOIRE).On the September 11th,2001, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plan Crash You can view the website in (http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/victims/AA11.
victims.html) Unfortunately, they all lost their life in the event of the Plan Crash. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client in one of the ECOBANK here. (cote d ivoire) Particularly, the deceased deposited the US$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundren thousand United States Dollars only)In the ECOBANK
   
  Consequently, this BANK issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin to claim the US$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand United States Dollars only) in their custody within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased to claim the fund as the Next of Kin to him so that the fund will be transferred to your account by the ECOBANK 
    Upon your interest and williness to help, both of us will make agreement on the sharing % of this fund before I commence on this funds on your name as the next of Kin to Mr/Mrs.Robert Norton.
As you may like to know Mr./MrsRobert Norton was a retiree from Lubec in france All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us seeing this deal through.
  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

My name is Venus Savimbi, the nephew of the late 
jonas savimbi the former leader of the UNITA rebel 
fighters in Angola. I am presently in Europe, where I 
intend to look for a credible business partner to 
assist my brother and I take physical pocession of a 
consignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 
(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united 
states dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody 
of my father in a security company in Ghana. 

My parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his 
will he clearly stated that my brother and I should 
look for a credible individual who would assist us in 
investing these funds, as we are not conversant with 
investment procedures in the world business and we 
have never been in posession of such funds all our 
lives. For these reasons, he believes that the only 
way we can live without him is if we get someone very 
vast in the field of business and investment to help 
us claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we 
can further our educations, as well as living our 
lives the way he wants us to. 

My brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the 
security company, and he has asked that I travel out 
to Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. 
I would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon 
as I receive your response, so you can deal with him 
directly, as he has all the modalties for the release 
of the consignment. 

We have both decided that we would make available to 
you for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money 
involved, but we have also decided to leave it open to 
negotiation. 

I would give you more details as soon as I hear from 
you. Till then I expect your prompt response.

Ecowas headquarters 
Lome,Republic of togo.

Attn:

Account provision for usd 9.5m

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you
asa surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am George Ugo,The Chairman, Contract
Awardind Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and deci! ded
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD9.5,000,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars only.)into your personal or
company`s bank account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis. 

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensiv! e
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,65%
will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to
defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings; 

YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
AND TELEX NUMBERS.

THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY 
WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents
and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (s! ensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.

Reply Asap. 
With Regards.

1,"ATTN:,

I am Godwin Ekpontu Sangana, Esq., A personal attorney to MR/MRS
MILLER, an expartriate formally with my country's branch of Agip
Oil Company(NAOC), here in Lagos. On April 21, 1999 my client,
Mr&MRS. MILLER died in a fatal automobile accident. Ever since, I
have made several frantic and extensive enquiries to locate any
of my late client's relatives which, to this time, has proved
unsuccessful. After these unfruitful attempts, however, I decided
to trace his relatives via the internet.This, of course, explains
this correspondence to you. I contacted you to assist in
repartriating the money left behind by my deceased client before
it gets confiscated or declared unserviceable as repeatedly
threatened by the bank where this deposit of a large amount of
money was lodged. For purposes of security, I cannot disclose the
amount until I am sure of your commitment to collaborate with me.

Recently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next-of-kin
or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull
in locating the the relatives for over 3 years of endless effort,
I seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the
deceased, Mr/mrs Miller.  So that the proceeds of this venture
can be remitted to your nominated account for you and I.  In the
event that you agree to render this assistance, I propose a
sharing formula of 65% for me and 30% for you,while 5% will be
for all expenses and inheritance tax, as may be required by your
government. 

I am certain that all necessary legal documents that will be used
to back up our inheritance claims and secure approvals are
readily accessible with little or no difficulty. All I require is
your honest cooperation to see the deal through. I guarantee that
this will be executed under a legitimate atmosphere that will
protect you from any breach of the law.  Please contact me by
email  and also send your phone and fax number for further
discussions.  God bless. 


Yours Faithfully, 
Godwin Sangana (Esq).

Dear in Christ,


Pls.To whom It May Concern.


I am Mrs. Shallort- Kanchev  Bashir  from KUWAIT .I am married to Mr. Kanchev  Bashir.He worked with KUWAIT embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2005. We were married for eleven years without a child.


He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his

death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to

remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $1.6Million (One

Million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) in a Security company here in Cote D'Ivoire Abidjan.


Presently,this money is still at the Security company were he made the deposited of the fund onto my name as the next of kin. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.


Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church that

will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a

church that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word

of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that? Blessed is the hand that giveth?.


I took this decision because I don?t have any child that will inherit this money and my plenty of relatives are not Christians and I don't want my our efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way.


This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I

know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the

Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that, the lord will fight my case and I shall

hold my peace. I don't need any telephone

communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of

my husband?s relatives around me always.

I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are

possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of

the Security company here in Abidjan, and you've to contact them for the realising of the fund to your destination.


I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me

because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of

a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him

in spirit and Truth.


Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on the above

e-mail address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing

another church for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act

accordingly as I Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply remain blessed in the Lord.


Yours in Christ,

Mrs. Shallort-Kanchev  Bashir.

Also the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments notes, which I have these information in my custody now. 
You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.

Please my dear,I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.I have secretly deposited the sum of $30,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications.
 
The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number 009GM. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you.I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance.I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account.I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect the transfer accordingly.
 
Is rest assured that the modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the successful transfer of the funds.So, you will be absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email with following details: 
1. YOUR NAME 
2. POSTAL ADDRESS 
3. PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS 
Also this transaction demands absolute confidentiality.On no condition must you disclose it to anybody irrespective of your relation with the person.Remember,Loose lips sinks ship.I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email address above.

I am Mr. Koffi Adu, a lawyer/consultant for an African eminent personal who prefer to remain anonymous. He has shown proves to me, which I  verified professionally that his claims are true, sincere and accurate, as I wouldn't want my name and career smeared with mud. That he have a certain large sum of money in CASH (USD$5,000,000.00 �five million US Dollars) stashed away in security and finance house in Europe.  
My client is a politician; in an asylum, which explains why he prefers to remain anonymous. He have requested that I source for a reliable and capable foreigner to act as his partner, who will help to claim these funds from the security company after which it shall be use for investments as directed by my client with you as the manager.
(Though subject to a close study of feasibility expected to be supplied). The funds are duly protected professionally to avoid any unauthorized tampering or theft. A total of 20% of the total sum has been set-aside for you if you agree to be our partner as well as a 5%, which is mapped out for all expenses, which might be incurred in the process of claiming the funds from the security company in Europe.
As a lawyer, I am aware of the various similar propositions flying about on the internet and I must confess that I was reluctant to take up this task, but having carried out my investigations and confirmed that it is true, I can confidently tell you that this is no scam. Kindly revert back to me.
If you wish to be a partner with 100% assurance that you will not regret your decision.

Awaiting your prompt response.
Sincerely yours,

Mr. Koffi Adu.

     ===============================

My name is Mr.Oluwatobi E.Boye, the manager, credit and
foreign bills of Ecobank Plc. 

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who
perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801]
with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.
Since the demise of this our customer, I personally
has watched with keen interest to see the next of
kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come
to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which
has been with my branch for a very long time. 

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall
be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to
be the next of kin and the banking ethics here does
not allow such money to stay more than Six years,
because money will be recalled to the bank treasury
as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I
got your contact through a trade journal after
realizing that your name and country is similar to
the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon
the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax
or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the
next step to take. 


I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for
fund transfer can be finalized within five banking
days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to
the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly Call me on my private telephone number at:234-80-5507-1652
send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including
your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.


Respectfully submitted,

Oluwatobi E Boye.

NB:I would appreciate if you reply me to my private mailbox for security reasons at:oluwatobiboye@justmailz.com

Robert Ibe Guere of the then military government of Ivory Coast, prior to the time of crisis which is presently on I got your contact from a directory I have just acquired. Due to my position, as the son and benefficiary to the late General, I have been able to come away with a reasonable sum of money after the brutal murder of my parents by my father's political opponents, this money belongs to my father and is in the total sum of 19.8 million US$ of which I have the tendency to invest it in a company with good line of products like your own company and with potential for a good capital returns, on behalf of myself and the remaining members of my family. 
Since your country is one of the good investor friendly nations in the world, I have decidedto seek your assistance for me to transfer this funds to your country and run business over there, for the mutual benefit of both of us and my entire family. I would therefore like you to help me in every possible way in securing this funds in your country. 
Furthermore I will like you to assist me in finding a good business that I will invest this fund. However upon acceptance you will be required to contact me through my personal e-mail address as above (eddy37sure@she.com ) for security reason in which you will be informed and get update about the current arrangement i have made so far on how totransfer the money from Bangkok-Thailand to your account through a bank account that you will open in your name here. 
In view of your participation, I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance of which the trustee fee range in my country is between to 5% to 7% of the actual money or better still commit it into a joint venture project. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the fund belongs to me and the rest of my family now, of which i am the sole benefficiary and trustee on behalf of my younger ones who are currently on assylum some where. 
As soon as I get your consent, I will contact my lawyer to start making arrangement on how to change the ownership of the consignment into your name, for easy transfer of the money out of here, since you will be my trustee to the transaction and thereafter transfer to your country's foreign account and i will finally come over to your country for all the final arrangements. 
I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter. If you have any question do not hesitate to include same in your reply.

Two days before my father's death, he managed to sneak a written message to us explaining his condition and concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money, which he concealed under the roof. He instructed me to take my mother and two sister and Move out of Sierra Leone, immediately to any neighboring country.     The powerful peacekeeping force of the economic of West African (ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by the rebels overnight, the situation was so helpless that every body was running for there life's. My mother, two sisters and I managed to escape to South Africa safely with the box and some vital documents of property title.     The cash inside the box was US$11.7Million .Due to fear and limited rights as refugee, I deposited the items with a private security company with the help of one of the senior official working in the security company.

1,"FROM THE DESK OF : MR MOHAMAT ALI,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.


Attention Please,


I am Mr Mohamat Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting 
section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West 
Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a 
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end 
of the transaction .


During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.


The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement 
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get 
the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also 
benefit your self to this great business opportunity.


In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.


I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.


I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.


I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,


Yours faithfully,


Mr Mohamat Ali.

Presently,all the Documents concerning the FUND are with me, now that

  my sickness has gone to this stage,I am scared and I want the fund to

 be used for the work of God all over the world,i have prayed and told

 God to direct me to an honest christian who will receive this fund and 

 utilise it together with me and for things that will glorify the name

 of God,after my prayers,I decided to contact you alone my beloved in

  Christ. 

 

Please I will appreciate that you send the following information to

as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he
had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United
States dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as
Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this
land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe
Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some
black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by
Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were
killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the
victims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are
currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a
foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to
open any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As
The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking
a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced
with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear
of going through the same experience in future since both countries have
similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not
allow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your
assistance in the following:
1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see
face to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the
funds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,
which will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in
this transaction.
2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim
the boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a
local bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated
account in overseas.
3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I
am willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I
offer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any
other expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and
you get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above
Email, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss
further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,
while you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.
Please kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.
Sincere Regards,
Michael Stevens Junior.

1,"Attn: The President/CEO 
I am Mr. Fred Mende, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
On June 8, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.com

Thanks and regards. 
Mr.Fred Mende.

1,"Dear Friend, 

My name is Mr. Micheal Ipenza, I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been well taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. 

I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. 
To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry, foreign trade division. 
An account was open by a  foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife 
on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.
 
PROPOSITION; 
 
Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25,000,000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. 
 
Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year. 
It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. 

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 
 
1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account, and for us to see face to face. 

2. Details, particulars of your contact address. 

3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions. 

I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final 
conclusion of this project for your assistance, as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country. 
 
If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance. 
Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct e-mail address michealipenza@netscape.net. 

Thanks and best regards, 
 
Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

EMAIL  PLS REPLY TO THIS BOX  -(ahmedmustafa22@netscape.net)

My name is Ahmed Mustafa, Principal Partner in Ahmed
Mustafa LawChambers, London, UK. I use to be a
personal attorney to Mr. MohammedSaibi who was the
chairman of Algosaibi Diving and Marine Services
inDhahran, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year
of heart attack atthe ripe age of 79 years.

Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist,
before he died, madea Will in my law firm stating that
$5.2M (Five million, Two HundredThousand U.S. dollars
only) should be donated to any charity home of
ourchoice overseas as his last contribution to
humanity when it becameobvious that he will not be
alive for too long. His only son, RasheedSaibi and his
entire family has no knowledge of this. However, I am
verymuch aware that he has left enough wealth that
will last his generation alife time. 

The true situation at the moment is that the said
amount of money wasdeposited with a security company
only to be paid out to a charity home.The charity
home/organization would have to be picked by my law
office.This implies that you will stand as the
beneficiary to this Will so thatthe funds could be
processed and transferred to your account if you
areready and in a position to assist me. You do not
need to have a charityorganization, all you need do is
to declare your interest and showseriousness. The
paper works to present you as the benficiary will be
doneby me.

I am particularly interested in securing this money
from the Securitycompany because they have issued a
notice instructing us to produce thebeneficiary of
this Will as soon as possible, else the account would
bemade dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long
period of time before hisdemise.

If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you
30% of theentire funds after paying taxes due to your
government and expenses duringthe course of this deal
withdrawn from it. The balance will be minealthough I
intend to send some of it to a charity organization.

I urge you to contact me immediately for further
details if you aresatisfied with my proposition and
feel you are in a position to assist me.Bearing in
mind the confidential nature of this transaction, I
will prefer you respond through mail.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Ahmed Mustafa Esq.

With all sincerity and humility it is with deep pains i write you this
message of wishful assistance to my predicament. I am Mrs Jewel Taylor
the estranged wife to the former president of Liberia who was asked by
unanimous decision by the international community to step down from the
corridors of power .

I write you this mail under duress and as a result of my recent
decision to better the lives of i and my children. I have made a
decision which i know might not be good in the sight of man but the
present situation has led me to this decision to better the lives of my
children. Currently now i have decided to make do with the sum of $20m
(Twenty Million United States Dollars)belonging to my husband in which
i am a benefiaciary to, i have decided to relocate with your
assistance to your private account the said sum.

My decision was reached when i could not conceive the thought that
after the United States Government has promised to let my husband go
free based on the condition that he should step down Mr. Collin Powell
stated in a press briefing that he would be indicted by the court in
Netherlands to face charges on war crimes, this is what led to my
decision as God Knows that i was never in support of his involvement in
the indecent maltreating of innocent people in Politics.

This decision is hard for me to make but i just have to make it for the
sake of my children's future.

Currently the said sum was lodged in a safety deposit box in a
financial Institution which i will disclose to you as a matter of
commitment to me and this plea for assistance. I currently have the
deposit certificate and can draw up a change of beneficiary mandate to
effect you as the beneficiary to the funds. I am a trained economist by
profession and it is in this line that i will want you to take note
that your services for assisting me will be compensated to the best of
my ability.

I have this to look forward to so i would like you to keep this
project close to your heart just as myself pending when we reach the
conclusive end of this project. I will want you as a matter of
confidentiality to respond through this mail and also include your
telephone number as well so that i can give you a call if the need
arises as we are currently on political asylum now in west africa. Once 
i
get your confirmation that you can be of assistance i will bring you
into a clearer picture of the situation at hand.

Dear,

After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$25 Million (Twenty five Million United States Dollars) First, let me start by introducing myself, I am Mrs. Jocelyn Momodu, a mother of three children and a widow from democratic republic of Congo.

My husband Major James Momodu was a major in the democratic republic of Congo army, and was heading the procurement department of the army, in purchase of the arms and ammunitions for the war, in our country under the government of the Late LAURENT KABILA, who was killed by the security agent.

For some years now weve been living in South Africa as asylum seekers, and we have been favoured with refugee status under the South African government umbrella after my husbands death on the 5th of April 2005.

Before the death of former the [D.R.C.] president Mr. Laurent Kabila, my husband was assigned to buy ammunitions worth of USD$25 MILLION DOLLARS from the South African arms manufacturing company. But on the processes of his negotiations with this firm in Johannesburg, the news of the presidents death came to him. 

Automatically he sees no reasons to continue with the negotiations and use the opportunity to divert the fund in his possession. For our personal gain. 

As he thought its of no use fighting for selfish power and killing innocent people of my country, many has already lost their lives and properties in the long war. Millions has also left their homes and seek asylum all over the world. 
Majority of the government personals has diverted millions of the countrys funds to their foreign account overseas.

As a matter of fact we have no other option than to deposit this fund as it is sealed in a diplomatic box into a private security and finance company for safekeeping here in Johannesburg for my own use and seek for political asylum. 

And since then weve been living as asylum seekers in this country. After our refugees status was granted the refugee status prior to my husbands sudden death, I contacted a bank last week to open an account and request for my possible investment in South Africa, as I do not think of going to back to my county. I was surprise as the bank told me that I would not invest this money myself due to my political status. I was told that am not allowed to invest or operate any business. The bank manager advised that I did better look for a foreign investor who will come to South Africa, open a non-residence investment account where the fund will be deposited and transferred out of South Africa to his or her account overseas. 
Due to the fact that I cannot invest this fund in South Africa as a result of my political status. I want your assistance in clearing this money from the security firm. Whereby standing as the soul beneficiary.
For your assistance, I am offering you USD5 Million (Five million United States Dollars Only) however, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with the money when transferred into your account. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency contact me at the contact number or you may alternatively send me an email on my  private email address at; Jocelyn_momodu_01@excite.com.

If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest with you. I will also like you to give me your contact address or private telephone; fax and email to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time. Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality of this transaction if we must succeed.  Note that this transaction is risk 100% free as all arrangements have been made for a successful deal with my lawyer and the bank director involved. If you do not feel comfortable with this proposal, do not hesitate to discontinue. 

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family. 

Yours faithfully,

Mrs. Jocelyn Momodu.

ATTENION:

           MONEY TRANSFER / INVESTMENT PROPOSAL
INTRODUCTION:
Please I do not wish to invade your privacy by sending this
mail to you. I am Mr james obi , a Civil Servant in the
Federal Ministry of Health . I know this proposal will come
to you as a surprise because we have not met physically or
through correspondence.

I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in
Nigeria and have no doubt about your ability to handle a
huge sum of money.
THE SUBJECT:
My father Chief Solomon Dama (Now Late) was the Royal Head
of my community , Eleme (an oil rich town) in Nigeria . My
community produces 5.8% of the total crude oil in Nigeria
and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my
father as royalty by the Federal Government . My father was
also the head and chairman of Eleme Special Oil Trust Fund
. In his position as the royal head and chairman of the Oil
Trust Fund , he made some money which he left for me as the
only heir to inherit. The money is Twenty Five Million, Two
Hundred Thousand US Dollars ($25.2M). This money originated
from the accumulated royalties between 1976-1998. Due to
poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as
a result of past military interventions , he deposited this
money in a vault with an open beneficiary to a security
company pending when he will finish arrangement to transfer
it abroad. He was planning this when he suddenly died late
last year of heart attack.
THE PROPOSAL:
Just before my father died , he called my attention to the
money and charged me to look for a foreigner who will
assist in the transfer /investment of the funds abroad . So
I will be very grateful if you can accept to help me in
this regard . I promise to give you 20% of the total funds
transferred to your vital bank account as compensation for
your assistance . Five percent (5%) would be set aside to
take care of all expenses we may incure during transaction.
To indicate your interest , contact me urgenly and
confidentially for more information and the roles you will
play in this business. All the legal documents concerning
this money will be sent to you as soon as we reach a
compromise. Maybe this will be the beginning of an intimate
and rosy relationship between my family and yours
Send your reply asap and may the almighty God bless you

Yours Faithfully,

Mr james obi

ATTN: SIR,

PRIVATE AND HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

Greeting! I know you will be surprised to read from
me, but please this letter is a request from a family
in dire need of assistance. I am Mr. Ahmed Williams
from Angola. The first and the only son of Brigadier
Chanza Williams communicating to you from
Johannesburg, South Africa.

I got your address from a business directory in
Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And,
I, on behalf of my widowed mother Mrs. Bridget
Williams decided to solicit for your assistance to
transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five
Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars),
which he deposited in a safe box to private security
company in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In fact, my father said, and I quote: ?My son, I wish
to draw your attention to US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five
Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).
I deposited the box containing the fund in a security
company in Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables.
During the war, I was very committed and dedicated in
winning the war against the rebels, until I found out
that the senior army officers and government
functionaries were busy helping themselves with
government funds and properties, sending them to
foreign countries. Due to this, when the former
adviser to the president and I were assigned by the
president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in
South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and
diverted the money and share it, of which I got a
total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). In
case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only
you should solicit for assistance of a reliable and
sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this
money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I
deposited the box in your name and you can claim it
alone with deposited code. Your mother is with all
the documents. Take good care of your mother and your
sisters.

>From this words of my late father, you can understand
that life and future of my family depend on this fund,
as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. We
are now living in South Africa as political asylum
seekers. Financial laws and regulations of the
Republic of South Africa do not permit us certain
financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest
this fund in South Africa hence; I am seeking your
assistance to transfer this fund out of South Africa
for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are
prepared to offer you 20% of the total fund while 10%
will be set aside for any expenses incurred during
this transaction.

Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free
and the major thing I demand from you is to assure me
the safety of this money when it finally gets to you.
Further information and arrangement commence as soon
as trust confidence and good relationship are
established. I shall be most grateful if you maintain
the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm
your interest through the above contact Telephone
number and send me a mail on :hammedwilliams2005@gmail.com .

Best regards,
AHMED WILLIAMS
For the family.

1,"My Dear,

I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign 
remittance department Bank Of Africa.

In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million 
five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our 
foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him
at the plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision 
of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 50% be for me.

Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the 
percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as arranged, you must apply
first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your 
bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number 
for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be 
transfer.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting 
to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully.

Mrs Aicha Ahmed.

1,"John William  61 Fann Residence Dakar Senegal E-mail:johw75@yahoo.com   Attention: The President/CEO. I am Dr John William, Bank Manager in one of the leading banks here in Dakar Senegal. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. A contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation made a numbered time Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$27,000,000.00 (Twenty seven Million Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers, Teaser Petroleum Corporation that MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany died in a plane crash along with his entire family in July 2000.PLEASE TAKE A CAREFULL LOOK AT THE BBC PUBLISHED Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigated and discovered that Mr. Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$27,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Senegal, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt governme!  nt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that I will place every necessary information about you in the late account owner�s file and our computer data base as his next of kin entitled to inherit his deposited fund. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 30% for you. The remaining 20% will be for any expenses we might incurred during the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the su!  ccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, ple ase reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Dear sir,

TRANSFER OF $26,948,500.00 ON ACCOUNT NUMBER 262 -866-5050

I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before.Besides,I only got your address from an internet listing.

I am Dr.Donald Ike,Head of Banking Operations,Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious.

The account numbers mentioned above  belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf,a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI,a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream sector of my country for its professional service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf .Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993,I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer,Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal cheques be paid to his online account,I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death!
 ,this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million,Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand,Five Hundred United States Dollars($148,948,500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder,the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased,that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal Authorities,instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man fo!
 r about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself 
shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank. 

All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the fund.Send to me immediately the your business porofile as well as your bank account information of any bank of your choice where you want the money to be transfered.You may open a new account if you so wish.If for any reason you think you're incapable of this transaction, you may recommend anybody whose integrity is not in doubt. I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private telephone numbers above or through my email address with information about your full contact addresses including personal telephone & fax numbers and Bank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you a!
 re capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.

I also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.

At the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.

I await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.

Warmest Regards.

Dr.Don Ike

Dear Friend,

How are you,first i will explain my self little to you
before we continue. I am the manager of bill and
exchange at the foreign remittance department of
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)I am writing to seek
your interest over a transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of
$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer
who died along with his entire family in November
2001  in a plane crash. Since we got information about
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to
come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of
kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our
banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin   or relation died
alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody
behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one
other official in my department have decided to make
this business proposal to you and release the money to
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and we dont want this money to go into
the Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after five years, the
money will be transferred into the Bank's treasury as
unclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of
kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a
foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses
incurred during the business and 50 % would be for me
and my colleague. There after I will visit your
country for disbursement of the fund according to the
percentages indicated in this proposal. Therefore to
enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as
relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating
your bank name, your bank account number, your private
telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where in the money will be
remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by
email the text of the application. I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch
free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for
the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you
receive this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Dear Sir,, I am Barr.Tony Anthony, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Late Eng. Sangeeta a national of your country, who used to work with Chevron - Development Company in Accra Ghana. Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 25th of December 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in Plane clash on cotonue. All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their lives except few people. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. 
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16.5 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next Thirty (30) Working official working days.  Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this account valued at USD16.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 30% to you and 10% will be used for any expenses.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my private email (tonywach45@yahoo.no)and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.  Best regards,Barr.Tony Anthony.

HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONG KONG.

Dear Sir,

 Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. 
 So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years and 6months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
 Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.
 Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Mr. Wang  Qin

URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
 
I am Mr.PAULSON  BENSON the elder son of late Mr.JAMES BENSON of Zimbabwe. I got your contact address from the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry please don't worry. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in my country, 
 
he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in the country and although a black indegene, he did not support the President?s political ideology.Therefore, the president?s supporters invaded my father?s farm burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments. After the death of my father,
 
 my mother and I together with my younger brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. On our departure from Zimbabwe,we took along with us some money which my father kept in the safe in my mother?s custody which amounted to the sum of US$15,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) to the Republic of South Africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company and sought  for political asylum. My mother has suggested and I agree that we have to further move out of the African continent to overseas for actual safety and to do reliable business investments.
 
Therefore we have decided that I should contact any reliable overseas person/firm/company who could assist us to transfer this money out of South Africa through a current investment account because as refugees  we are not allowed to operate any account exceeding US$2,000(Two Thousand US Dollars). So we need your help to come down to South Africa to open a bank account through which we can transfer this money to your country.If my proposal is considered, 
 
for assisting us to Transfer this money to your country, we unanimously agree to offer you 20% of the total fund,5% will be for any expenses that may be incuured during the
transaction ,75% will be for me and my family to invest in your country under your assistance.

1,"MY MESSAGE FOR PEACE AND HARMONY

Dear brothers & sisters,

We all need to pray for one another, and to love one
another. We should always pray for the safety, peace,
love and brotherhood for people all over the world.
Too bad we can't have an independence day for the
entire world. A day of freedom from ignorance, hatred,
war, illusions, power and control. A day where we can
all love each other as human beings and toss away the
weapons of war, and cast out our fears and hatreds
from our hearts into the graves. We must mourn the
graves of the innocents all over the world, and give
the children of the world the hope of a peaceful,
loving and beautiful world. 

A world full of love and without hatred or fear. A
world where we can join hands together and accept one
another, regardless of our skin color, ethnic
divisions, religion or nationality. If we don't unite
as a human race, then we have condemned the future
generation of children a dark and very grim future. 

Think of love, compassion and peace always...


MY PRAYER  FOR  PEACE AND HARMONY

Merciful God, You made all of the people of the world
in Your own image and placed before us the pathway of
salvation through different Preachers who claimed to
have been Your Saints and Prophets. But, the
contradictions (made by us) in the interpretation of
Your teachings have resulted in creating divisions,
faith based hatreds and bloodshed in the world
community. Millions of innocent men, women and
children have so far been brutally killed by the
militants of several religions who have been
committing horrifying crimes against humanity and
millions more would not be butchered by them in the
future, if You guide and help us find ways to reunite
peacefully.

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL,
look with compassion on the whole human family; take
away the controversial teachings of arrogance,
divisions and hatreds which have badly infected our
hearts; break down the walls that separate us; reunite
us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and
confusion to accomplish Your purposes on earth; that,
in Your good time, all nations and races could jointly
serve You in justice, peace and harmony.  (Amen)

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA
OUAGADOUGOU,
BURKINA FASO.




Sir,
I am MR OMARU AMINU,the director,in charge of Auditing and Accounting 
section of International Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina faso,in West 
Africa in due respect and regards.I have decided to contact you on a 
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end 
of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across 
a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person, a foreigner who 
died on november 2000  in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his 
account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either 
from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.

Although personally,i kept this information secret within myself and 
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful 
during the time of execution.The said amount was USD$14m (fourteen million 
united states dollars). As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact 
through international business enquiry on internet.

I believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such 
magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put 
claim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the 
required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put 
in place and directives/needed information will be relayed to you as soon as 
you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit 
your self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account 
and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request 
as it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank 
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills 
etc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised 
to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from 
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole 
situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And 
ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund 
according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either 
in your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All 
other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I 
suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this 
deal.

Yours faithfully,
MR OMARU AMINU.

1,"Dear Friend
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. 
I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in 
good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the 
CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at 
US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was 
moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on 
the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to 
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. 

On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he 
did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any 
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no 
one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not 
aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.
With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. 
By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of 
above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country 
immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money. 
I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to 

late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of 
the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. 

All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under 
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are 
interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. 
I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: drateeq299@yahoo.com.au
Regards, 
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.   "

Dear Beloveth,
I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah,
former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf
Island.
I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history,
which  has already been disseminated by the international media during the
controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother,
the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.
As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my
father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion
dollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my
father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei
Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.
However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and
private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later
confiscated by the  sultanate.
Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my
immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from
the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was
placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone
but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this
mail.
Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred 
Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special
arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and Trustee
companys for safe keeping abroad.
The money where splitted and kept in the following countries in this
proportion: US$50 Million is in Switzerland, US$100 Million is in London,
US$100 Million is in Malaysia, US$80 Million is in United Arab Emirate
and the balance US$US170 Million is in Holland.
Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable
investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family
abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as compensation
for your strong cooperation.
Please I count on your absolute confidentiality,transparency and trust
while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of
this  business transaction.
I remain yours sincerely
Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah
Brunei Darussalam.
please reply to my privite email address-ROYALMAJESTY@K.RO

1,"CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTD
LAGOS, NIGERIA


ATTENTION:SIR

I am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.I have resolved to contact you through this
medium based on business proposal that will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

I got your particulars through a consultant company
base on my research for atrustworthy and established
person that understands investment ethic for entering
into a life time profitable joint partnership
investment and also co-operation with confidence and
trust that you willkeep the contents secret and
divulged to any third party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited
aconsignment in our company\\'s vault for safe
keeping.And since then our client has failed to come
forward to claim his consignment, which has
accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in
demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this
client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment
had accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since
the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,
none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the
consignment with us, which means that non of his
relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment.
Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the
two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And
to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that
were registered as treasurer by our client actually
contained a considerable amount of money in United
States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million
Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing
plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and
the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot
of money from his country while he was in office as
head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment
in our vault was part of the money that our client
siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to
this money in our care.I am now soliciting your noble
assistance to assist me in transferring this money out
of nigeria to your country for immediate investment
with your assistance.I have also decided that you will
generously been titled to 30% of the total amount.
Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your
willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will
immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of
ownership of this consignment to your name to
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the
complete funds to yourcountry.
you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain
absolute confidentiality on this matter.
Please reply to the above email address with your
telephone and fax so can call you.
Thanks.
Yours faithfully.
MR.ISA MUHAMEED

1,"THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE
ECOWAS HEADQUATERS
ACCRA GHANA
WEST AFRICA.

I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in
ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect
and
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us
at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my
department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced
amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We
discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in
international
Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on
contract
payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me
and
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful
during
the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country
as I
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this
transaction.
Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment
of
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account
has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed
to
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and
also
benefit yourself in this great business
opportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position
in
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account
and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will
require
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the
contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be
tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due
verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this
transaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be
set
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
and
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and
my partners.
Please, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service
and
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be
monitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your
account,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
according
to percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I
hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish
in
this deal.

  Dear Sir,

Greetings . I am Hon. Rajesh Anand Bhagwan,MP.Republic of Mauritius. Presently I am the Minister of Enviroment and National Development Unit,under the Government of Prime Minister Hon. Paul Raymond .Acting in my capacity, I awarded a number of large Government building/construction contracts to a German Construction firm(Philipp Holzmann AG in Frankfurt am Main) worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the execution of this project the German firm discovered a colossal amount of precious stones in one of the sites. I collaborated with this firm in a mutual agreement as regards the proceeds of which I have now received my share of exactly US $48 million.I cannot introduce or circulate this amount into the Mauritian banking system considering my provisional duty as a minister, also earning less than $1000 equivalent of Mauritian Rupee (our local currency) and the strict stipulations of the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations for Public/Civil servants. Furthermore, Groups of persons'in the Government have ganged up against me, with false allegations of an intention by me to contest the next presidential elections .This has caused disent and discontent in my party circles, now prompting my decision to take flight with my family ,hence my soliciting your co-operation to take delivery of the funds into your custody for investment purposes .25% of the entire funds will be apportioned to you for your efforts and assistance I implore you to accord this transaction the confidentiality and secrecy it deserves no matter what your decision may be.

I urgently await your response!

next of kin or have the fund confiscated within the next ten official working
days. 

since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for overseveral
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased,so
that the proceeds of this fund valued at $27million U.S dollars can be paid
to you by the Company delivering the Consignment to your door step, then
you and I can share the money. 55%to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be

0,Babe? You said 2 hours and it's been almost 4 ... Is your internet down ?
1,"""How to turn 3 into 10,000"" 
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but with a little effort will make a nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spend, or pay for that much needed holiday

Please take the time to read the following information, which I received recently.
 
Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think about it for a few days, otherwise you could be throwing away over 10,000 in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just 3.00 (5/$5.00).

In March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over 10,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking ""What if it actually works?"" For the sake of 3 isn't it worth a go!
I put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than 3 (5/$5). 

What did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! 
The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than 10,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). 
This must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! 

Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. 

This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! 
This program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. 

You will need:
	An email address 
	A Premier or Business PayPal account with at least 3 (5/$5) deposited in it 
	30 minutes of your time 

PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. 

To get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! 

Here's what you need to do:
STEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.
http:/www.paypal.com 
 
STEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a 3 (5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: 
"" Please add me to your mailing list. "" 
Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under ""SEND MONEY"" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! 
Here's the current list: 

1.	hurst_l@lineone.net
2.	admin@makinscentz.com
3.	tracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
4.	charlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
5.	kingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk



STEP 3: Once you've sent a 3 (5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have ""Opted In"". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. 

The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).

Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)
No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! 
A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! 

When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. 
As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. 
If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). 
Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. 
Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. 
Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! 
Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive 3 (5/$5) from each of them, that's; 9,375 (3,125 x 3(5/$5).
 
So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position.

1,"FROM MISS Vivian Mutan  EMAIL:(vivianmutan@myway.com ) LIBERIAN  Dearest Beloved one,  Based on your profile, l am happy to request for your assistance and also to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.  I am Miss Vivian Mutan ,21years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA MUTAN. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can I completely trust you?  2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?  Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.  Thank you so much.  My sincere regards,  MISS Vivian Mutan"

Sir,

Accept my apologies for writing to you in this mode for it might be of inconvenience to you but due to my quest for an honest and reliable international assistance concerning a business here in my country Nigeria I have no other option than to go this length. I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. 
I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.
The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.        
As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.
To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.  Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Amsterdam.
This deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary  documents are presently in the possession of an attorney, presently in London.
This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the content is a considerable amount of money in United state dollars which i cannot  disclose to you for security purposes, until you have confirmed your willingness to assist me.
I would be pleased and grateful to you if you could assist me in 
collecting this consignment on my behalf from the security firm in Spain, upon  which i will be offering you a percentage for your efforts.

I wish to present this proposal for the purpose of investment in your country. My name is Patrick Gabo, the only child of Hon.Ferz Uotr Gabo the former Minister of Transport and Communication with the present Government of President Kabbah of Sierra-Leone.

My father and mother were arrested on 1st of Nov 2001 by Kabbah's Government on allegation of using their postion in the govenment to aid smuggling of diamond from the Kono diamond field,it was just a political vendetta.

My father later died in the prison,it was diagnonised that he was poisoned, but Government report says heart failure. Whatever it is, let God be the judge. He sent a note to me before his death, regarding a deposit of the sum of USD$8,000.000.00) Eight Million United States Dollars in a Finanice Firm in DAKAR SENEGAL.

He instructed Me to move immediately with the documents to a neighbouring country to seek asylum. I moved to the Republic of Mali where I spent some time before finally moving to DAKAR,to enquire about deposit.

My mother died just on Sept.26th, so i am kind of desolete.Meanwhile i have located the Finanice Firm, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund to road.

I have to introduce a trusted foreign partner who would be my trustee and investor, since the management of the Firm adviced that I should solicit for an individual or corporate organization to claim the deposit for me as they cannot release it directly to me due to my refugee status in Senegal. hence the need for your assistance.

I request that you be my trustee and assist me in effecting the transfer of the fund to your account or an account you will nominate. You will also be resposible for the investment and management of the fund untill i am able to join you after my education in your country. You and Me will agree on a percentage you will take for your assistance.

Please let me know immediately if you can assist me so that I will give you more informations about the deposit.

Looking forward to your candid and urgent and positive reply today on my Private Email: Adresse;(emailgabo@voila.fr).

I thank you in anticipation to your quick response.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

Patrick Gabo.

1,"Dear sir,

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you,to transfer to your 
overseas account,sum of,(US$10.500.000m)Ten million five hundred thousands 
United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal,I 
urgently want to know soonest you,If you are not capable to handle and 
acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for 
an investment in your country,tell me so that i can quietly look for another 
reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit 
enough to provide either an existing bank account
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds,even an empty 
a/c can serve to receive
this funds,as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this 
interest,believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Mona Noah the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing,I discovered a 
floating fund in an account opened in the our bank
since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again,after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of 
the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his
family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do 
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner 
of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner
before his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No 
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.

Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be 
approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid 
international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any foreigner 
with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because 
the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner 
too,and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account,which I will give to you upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with 
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this 
business.I need your strong assurance that
you will never,never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer 
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending on my physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence you
can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone 
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know 
that this business is confidential.

At the conclusion of this business,you will be given 35% of the total 
amount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.
you can contact me with:   mnoah12@hotmail.com
Yours truly,

Mr Mona Noah.

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO


I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I got your contact address
through internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable
person that will assist me in this transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars (twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an
account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY
2000 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased
as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to 
go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where in  the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail   through
my  private line +22676524743 or  email adress  azize_ouattara25@yahoo.com

1,"Dear sir/madam,

Assalamalekum

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that
this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat
it serious. I am Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan, a banker
with the Mashreq Bank Plc Dubai, UAE.  I am the
Accounts officer late Mr. Robert Chapman the African
Area Director of SIL International, who unfortunately
died in the crash of Kenya Airways Flight 431 in
Abidjan, Ivory Coast, January 30 2000. You will read
more stories about the crash on visiting this website,
news.airwise.com/airlines/archive/2000/kenya2000.html
and also in this website, where Chapman's company
talked about his death in the Kenya crash.  You shall
as well find the pictures of Chapman and his wife
there.  Mr. Chapman was from Hamilton, Ontario Canada.

Since the death of Chapman, I as his accounts officer
in the bank, have made several enquiries to locate his
only surviving relation, without any success. I came
across your name and contact, on the course of my
personal searching for Chapman's relations, so I
decided to contact you for this project.

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating and
securing the wealth left behind in a fixed deposit
account by Robert, before they get confiscated or
declared unserviceable by my bank. The board of my
bank, has issued a notice that after 2 months from now
and no next of kin shown up for the claim, the funds
will be confiscated and declared unserviceable. Since
I and my team have been unsuccessful in locating
Robert's relatives for sometime now, I seek your
consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the
deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the
proceed of this deposit valued at $USD7.5 Million
Dollars can be released to you.

The bank will release the funds to any foreigner who
has all related information/documents to the bank
account. I am in charge of this matter in my bank,
because I am his accounts officer. Your application
will be directed to my department for verification and
approval. Everything is under my control.   

I shall provide you all the information and copy of
the certificate of deposit issued to Robert when he
deposited the funds. I shall also involve a good
attorney who shall represent you in all the
appropriate offices for the claim. Please, find in the
attachment my work ID Card. This is just to proof to
you that my proposal is genuine. I also have all
necessary information we need for the claim and once
the money is transferred to you, I shall destroy all
the documents used for the claim and leave no traces.
After everything, you shall have 40% of the total
sum,while 60% for me.


All requires is your honest cooperation to enable us
see this business successful. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law. Robert
was a very good man and it is not wise to allow his
hard earned wealth to be stolen by the greedy
directors of my bank.

Further details awaits your response by email. PLEASE,
TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET. Please, confirm the
receipt of my Id Card in the attachment, as it was
difficult to attach.

Best Regards

Muhammad Khalil Hasan.

Dear Sir/Ma



Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise, since we have not met, permit me however, I am Barrister Jonathan Micheal, I am contacting you to kindly assist me in the Project below, which will be of mutual benefit to us both.


A salvadorean, Mr. Ramirez Cathy, 66 years of age and a very prosperous farmer made a huge bank deposit for investment in the sum of US$17.5 Million (Seventeen Million, Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars)he named his wife Mrs. Helga Cathy as the NEXT OF KIN . I was called upon as an Accredited Attorney to the bank to sign and endorse documents to thisdeposit on Mr.Cathy's behalf. Unfortunately, Mr. & Mrs.Cathy were killed in theJanuary 14, earthquake that rocked El Salvador, killing thousands ofpeople and 1,200 others were declared missing. The bank management now mandates me (being the lawyer that signed and endorsed the deposit papers for the deceased to trace the family relatives of the deceased so that the fund will be released to them.I was made to understand that they had no children. I made several efforts through the El Salvador High Commission in Lagos to contact any of the deceased family relatives, but to no avail. Failure to reach any of the family relatives of the deceased,the only option left for the Bank's Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the fund on trading and investment in the interestof


the bank.


In order to avoid this development since it has so far been impossible to trace any of the deceased familyrelatives. I now seek your permission and assistance to have you stand as a distant relatives to the deceased.


So that the fund can be released to you and we can use it for ourmutual benefit. I hope you do understand my concern in this matter, if we do not use this opportunity to claim this fund,since the deceased relatives cannot be traced, the management of the bank will declare the deceased's account dormant and revert the fund on Trading and Investment in the interest of the bank.


For your assistance, you will be compensated adequately with (40%) of them, total sum (55%) will be my own share while (5%) will be set aside to cover any incidental expense made both at home and abroad prior to this transaction . If you are interested in assisting me with this matter,please send to me urgently via my EMAIL thefollowingdetails below:



*Full name, Company or Private Address




*Telephone and Fax number(s).



Upon receiving the above details from you, I will work out every documents/proof representing you as the deceased BONA-FIDE distant relative and when this is done, you will be contacted by the bankfor the release and collection of this fund, which will be within one week of my receiving the above details from you.I will meet with you in your country for disbursement after the fund might have been released to you and also to discuss investment potentials as I will like to invest in your country with your assistance.Be assured that this transaction is 100% risk free, as I have taken all necessary modalities to enable a hitch free transaction.Kindly ensure to treat this matter in strict privacy (HighlyConfidential).

Dear Friend, 
 
It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent 
business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to 
seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient 
account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000, 
000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our 
arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund 
with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred 
into. 
 
On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 ( 
One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my 
colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the 
contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of 
sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves. 
 
The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors 
have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million 
United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the 
country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues 
and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary 
of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will 
retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will 
retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be 
set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby 
both parties during the fund transfer process. 
 
We request you cooperate with us and provide a convenient account 
number in a designated bank where this fund can be safely transferred 
to, we intend to come over to your country on the completion of the 
fund transfer to secure our own share of the funds. 
 
THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CCESS 
OF THIS TRANS ACTION. ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WELLINGNESS TO CO-OPERATE 
AND ASSURANCE THAT OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE GIVEN TO US WHEN THIS MONEY IS 
TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
TO TO ENSURE A NO RISK SITUATION ON THE SIDE OF BOTHPARTIES AND IT IS 
BELIEVED THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL LAST 20 WORKING DAYS, BARRING ANY 
DELAYS. SINCE WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS, OUR PLAN IS TO INVEST 
THIS MONEY INTO REAL ESTATE, STOCK AND PERHAPS IMPORTATION OF GOODS 
FROM YOUR COUNTRY BASED ON YOUR ADVISE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR YEARS HAS 
BEEN SPENT AS CIVIL SERVANT,AND WE MAY LIKELY RESIGN FROM GOVERMENT 
SERVICE TO PRIVATE BUSINESS AFTER THIS MONEY IS TRANFERED INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT. 
 
Please note that we have been careful and have worked out all the 
modalities for a smooth transfer of the fund to your designated Bank 
Account before contacting you. We would therefore not want you to 
expose this proposal to anybody for the purpose of SECURITY and its 
CONFIDENTIALITY. We alsobelieve you would not sit on our money when it 
is transferred eventually into your account as you get your 30% share. 
Please, be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free.

1,"Dear Sir,

Please I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise based on the fact that I have not had any previous contact with you. 

Briefly, I am master Nelson Williams, son of the late Mr.Richard Williams, former director of Sierre Leone Gold and Diamond Corporation who was  murdered by assailants .

Shortly before this unfortunate incident, my father had informed me about an important contract he had executed (supply of Gold and diamond Mining Equipments)where he realized this fund ($15.5m)fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars and later when he heard the rumor of war in my country Sierra Leone he move the fund to Ghana where he deposited it. 

He showed me some lodgment documents with which he had deposited the money encased in a trunk box with a security /safe deposit company here in Accra Ghana

He informed me in confidence that the security company is not aware of the exact contents of the box , rather he had told them that it contained African artworks 
that he had assembled for his overseas partner who would soon be coming to claim them for exportation. As a result of this explanation, the box was accepted for safe-keeping by the security company without  inspection. 

When the political situation in Freetown, Sierra Leone worsened, I escaped into Accra , Ghana and had since contacted the security company, identified  myself properly and informed them about the sad fate my father had suffered. I presented the lodgment 
documents and they confirmed that they have the trunk  box in their vault.

So I informed them that I intend initiating contacts with my fathers overseas partner who owns the consignment so that he can come and take delivery of it. 

My decision to retrieve this box, transfer the money and start a new life forms
the basis of this enquiry from you.

1) Could you assist me with the logistics and a good personal/company bank account through which I can retrieve the consignment out he security company 
and transfer this money out of Ghana ?

2) Could you advise me on a good business proposition into which I can invest this money so that it would yield good dividends 

3) Could you assist me obtain resident papers in your country so that I can continue my education there from where I stopped.

I sincerely will agree to any suitable percentage you may request for your assistance to me. 

I shall prefer most of our communication to be done via phone. I need not inform you that this matter is strictly confidential. I want you to treat it as such.

God will surely bless you in abundance as you made up your heart to help an orphan like me. 

Nelson Williams.

MR ERIC WONG
PROPERTY & LEASE MANAGERS
26 KESINGTON COURT LONDON,
ENGLAND.

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of
us. A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced
your name and address, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as
it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with this
matter.

I am Eric Wong a property Manager to a deceased Immigrant property
magnate who was based in the U.K., also referred to as my client.

On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client, his wife and
their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for
New York in their plan for a world cruise,

I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and some others
which he put out for sale. The properties which have long been put out 
on
sale have now been paid for and now the money paid has long been
deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to 
assist in
repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client before they
get confiscated or declared unserviceable by his bank. Particularly,
the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin 
or
have the account confiscated within a short period of time.

My late client has an account valued at 30 Million United States
Dollars Only. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my 
clients
relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward since my
clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now 
seek
your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased client, 
so
that the proceeds of his account valued at 30 Million United States
Dollars Only can be paid to you.

1,"Dear Sir, 
Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Alan Jack a Zimbabwean Farmer. 
I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed, just as reported by the International media. 
This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. 
Therefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18, 500,000.00 (Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials. For now, I stay in Asia, because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the Security Company in UAE Dubai. 
Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all the numerous SCAM letters flying around the internet world today. The money (USD18.5m) already stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for further discussion. Lest I forget, you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your support and cooperation in the transaction. It�s also your duty to assist me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate response. 
Best Regards and God bless. 
Mr. Alan Jack

Dear sir,
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.
Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an oversea agent.
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.
The deal in brief, is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use.
For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent.
Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction,all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire estates in your country.
As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into youraccount, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen.
You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal to me,After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindlydelete/detroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of personalities involved.
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
Yours sincerely,
KAYODE PHILLIP."

ATTN:Sir/Madam,

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my
colleagues. Your information was given to me by a member of the South African
Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage
foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of
this business.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two
other t! ! op officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US
funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$26.500,000.00
(TwentySix Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess
balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship with foreign
governments and non-government agencies, we included our bills for
approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank
(SARB). We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the
unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim
to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your
Company.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation
will be US$6.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$17.225m
(65%) and the balance of US$2.650m (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses incurred.

The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with
utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company
does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour
of you/your Company. Also, your area of specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by my email  
address:morganxhosa2005@workmail.co.za
for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

T! ! hanks for your co-operation.

DR.MORGAN XHOSA.

1,"The President/CEO

Dear Sir/Madam,

It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request which I believe 
will come to you as a surprise since both of us are complete strangers.

I am MR. AHMED, ABACHA the son of the late General SANNI ABACHA former 
president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

In brief details, after the death of my father the government of Nigeria 
arrested my elder brother and kept him in jail being the heir apparent of my 
late father until he was made to sign an authorization empowering the 
government to frozen all of my fathers account and seized his landed assets 
alleging that my late father looted the federal treasury during his tenure 
in office thereby leaving the family with visually no source of livelihood 
except for the goodwill we receive from family friends who appreciated the 
good and kindness done by our heroic father while in office as president.

As if this inhuman act of the government was not enough, they frozen the 
account of my mother and restricted her movement even within the country. 
The family being faced with financial difficulties and having exhausted all 
avenues to make the present government return some of the money and landed 
assets confiscated from us, we launched a vigorous manhunt for any 
investment my late father could have maintained overseas directly or 
indirectly. In our relentless effort, last month we stumbled into a vital 
document kept in a little safe hidden in the basement of our house revealing 
that he maintained a private vault box deposit with a private finance and 
security firm in the Republic of South Africa. According to this document he 
has the sum of US$125,450,000.00 (One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Four 
Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) in his vault box deposit 
which the security firm is not aware off.

Therefore, in our bid to recover this investment, my mother request that I 
immediately travel to South Africa to hold discussions with the management 
of the security company to discuss possible ways the family can take 
possession of the investment deposit being held with them. It was on this 
premise I was told by the management of the company that the agreement 
entered into with our late father is that his safe box deposit will be 
collected upon his instruction by his friend in the United States. This we 
strongly believe he did for security reasons as the then president. The 
management had therefore insisted that for them to release the vault box 
deposit, my family must appoint someone who can stand in for my late father 
on behalf of the family.

In view of the above, my mother have asked me to stay behind in South Africa 
to source for someone from the United States who is willing to assist our 
family which is in die need at this point in time.

However, please note that this transaction is guaranteed, safe and secured.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at once should you be interested to 
help my family. Also, my family has decided to part with 25% of the total 
sum for your kind cooperation and assistance. My contact me with E-mail,

Best regards,

Ahmed, Abacha

From, Miss ZACHI Medina
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire 
West Africa.

Hello Dear Chosen one, 
Please excuse me for all the inconveniences my mail could cause you.I 
saw your profile and have the intrest on you . Please  even if we never 
knew before, I believe firmly that on the basis of the right of 
humanitarian assistance that a real confidence and love can arise from 
our communication and  also a real partnership between  us. 

I am Miss Medina ZACHI , the legitimate daughter of the Director of 
cocoa export here murdered by the rebelles here because of the 
political crisis going on here since four years ago. 

My father had deposited a consignment  with a  security company here  
containing the sum of  $9.000,000 USD (Nine million dollars USD) To 
allow him to conceive a project of investment at the end of his mandate 
here. 

Regrettably the fate decided on it otherwise. 

Today my major concern  is to move out  this sum outside here. Given 
that I am the only child and I have seriously suffered from the 
raggings and the harassments on behalf of the political opponents of my 
Father.

It is in this prospect that I contact you  to please help me  to move 
this heritage  from the security company to your country.

Because of the political war and the hostilities in this country  I 
seriously wish to leave from here and  live the rest of my life in a 
more peaceful and politically more stable and quiet country. It is  
what justifies  this demand. 

I shall voluntarily agree on a good and appropriate percentage of this 
money as your compensation for your assistant as for what precedes. 

I would like to count on your human, virtuous and professional 
qualities. 
I look forward to recive your urgent responds.
Thanks for your care .

1,"Dear friend,

My name is Barrister John Mensah, 41 years Ghanaian
married with Five Children. I work as an
administrative Secretary/Attorney with GLOBAL
SECURITY COMPANY (ltd) Accra Ghana. I joined the
services of this company in 1991.

I got the information concerning you and your company
from our Chamber of Commerce here and after due
consultation, I decided to contact you believing that
by the grace of God that you will be my
partner in this business. I have worked with this
company for over 12 years, within this period of time
I watched with meticulous precision on
how African Head of State and government functionaries
have been moving huge sums of money (Dollars, Pound
Sterling, French Franc, Cash)with the aid of their
foreign partners abroad.

They bring in these consignment of money cash and
secretly declare the content as jewelries, Gold,
Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc.
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra
Leone, FelixHouphet Buigny of Ivory Coast, Konnan Bede
of Ivory Coast, etc.

These people have at one time or the other
depositedconsignments withus and their foreign
partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here
unclaimed for as much as 7 years, as no available
information to anybody except the depositors, and most
of them are dead. Since the inception of the year
2003, GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY LTD Management changed
the procedure of claiming of consignments.

As soon as you are able to produce all the secret
information as contained in the secret file of the
company as regard the consignment, it will be released
to you upon demand. From our records, more
than 10 consignments belonging to these people has
been claimed in the past six months and this is why I
am seeking for your co-operation and assistance.

Mr. Francis Carden is a Zimbabwean, and he work with
one of the top ministers of President Robert Mugabe
who was in charge of the campaigning for re-electing
Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He
deposited this consignment in 1999 after absconding
with the money 35.5 million United State Dollars
($35.5m USD).

Unfortunately, Mr. Francis Carden died in Kenyan
aircraft that killed all on board in 2000.

Since his death, no one knows about this transaction
with Global Security Company Ltd except me who acted
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment.
I have finished every arrangement for you to come and
claim the consignment as the next of Kin to Mr.
Francis Carden.

The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to
the Director of operation Global security company pty
Accra - Ghana, for the release of consignment
No.GSS/15031964.

They will demand for some documents and the security
code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply
you with every detailed Information as regard the
consignment.
As soon as they have confirmed it to be correct, the
company will invite you for the collection.

Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the deal
, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio
of 50%-40%and 10% will go for humanitarian service ie
motherless babies home, more also you will make an
arrangement on investments that I will invest my money
in your country.

I assure you that this business is very secure and
risk free.

Please, if you are not interested on this proposal,
kindly let me know.

Thanks

Barrister John Mensah

Good a thing to write you,which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 
Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams ,of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams. Our Father was a highly reputable business magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Lagos during His days. 
 
It is sad to say that He passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.
 
Though His sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of ours who travelled with Him at that time. But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small ,and since then our Father took us so special.
 
Before His death, My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500,000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money.
 

>From Gordon and Rose
We are just young 16 and 18 years old and a high school college people, with  little knowledge of business that is why We are in need of a partner whom  will assist us to get this fund released for investments in his or her country while I proceed with our education,
 
Dear,
We are in a sincere desire of your humble assistance on this regard, and your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.
Now permit me to ask these few questions?
 
1. Can you honestly do this transaction with Us ?
2.can We completely trust you?
 
Please,Consider this and get back to us as soon as possible so that we can give you the full informations that will be need. And We will want you to know that you are the frist person we have contacted for this transaction.
Thank you so much and God bless you abundantly.

1,"Sorry to contact you in this manner. Difficulties encountered in efforts to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate this search for someone to assist me. 
My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money. 
To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our properties.

The money has since been deposited with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to you. All other information required to secure the funds will be given to you pending a positive response.
A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers will be highly appreciated.

 PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Late 
herina bana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in 
Sudan for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were 
married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief 
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were 
both very devoted muslims. 
 
Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and 
fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited 
the sum of $20 Million (Twenty  Million U.S. Dollars) with an 
oversea private security and holding firm . 
 
Presently, this money is still with the private security and 
holding firm in Malaysia ,Asia. Recently, my Doctor told me that 
I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. 
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my

 condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or 
devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to
 instruct here- in. I want this muslim organisation or individual to use this
 money in all sincererity to fund mosques, orphanages,widows and also propagating
the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of

the holy Quran. 
 
The holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged 
me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I don��t have any child 


that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christians
 converts and I don��t want my husband��s hard earned money to be misused
 by people I call unbelievers. 
 
I don��t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. 
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death 
I will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful. I don��t 
need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and 
the presence of my 
husband��s relatives around me always. I don��t want them to know about 
this development. 
 
With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply 
I shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also 
issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- 

beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim community where 
you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life 
of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to 
serve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. 
 
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your 
reply will give me room in sourcing For a muslim organisation or a 
devoted muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams
 will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the almighty ALLAH continue 
to guide and protect you.

UNION BANK PLC
My name is Usman Bello the manager, credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1998.
Since the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.
And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
The deceased. 
When you receive this letter. Kindly, send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication through my private email box at dr_usmanbello20033@yahoo.com

1,"Dear friend,

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter,
which I believe will be a suprise,as we are both
complete strangers. As you read this,I don't want you
to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will
die someday. My name is Raad Ibrahim, a former
merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.(United Arab
Emirates), I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
cancer which was discovered very late, due to my
laxity in caring for my health.

It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I
have only about a few months to live, according to
medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life
so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even
myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was
never generous, I was always hostile to people and
only focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for, but now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.

I believe when I have a second chance to come to this
world I would live my life a different way from how I
had lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have
willed and given most of my properties and assets to
my immediate and extended family members and as well
as a few close friends. To correct my wrong past life, 
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, 
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on 
earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this my self anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there
to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left for them. The last of
my money which no one knows of is the huge cash
deposit of 15,000,000 million dollars, (fifteen
million dollars), that I have with a Fiducial Company
in Europe I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and
you must be sending me information of how it was
disbursed either by email to:raadibrahim004@netscape.net 
or otherwise.
 
10% of the funds(15 million), will be for your time and patience,
logistics and overhead.

I wait in anticipation for your response.

Thanks,

Raad Ibrahim.

Dear Sir.
 
 May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble 
 self. I am Kokor Mobutu, the son of the late Zaire
 Republic President, Mobutu Sese Seko.
 Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody
 the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United
 States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales
 of
 diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.
 
 My father lodged this money in a security company
 outside our country for security reasons and because
 of the political instability in my country. 

 
 My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before
 his death. He however deposited this money without
 any
 name rather, with coded numbers which is in my
 possession. With my father dead, my life was at
 great
 risk, I therefore had to leave my country under
 cover
 to
 Spain.
 
 Now, I have decided to invest this money in a
 suitable
 and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek
 your assistance to transfer this money to your bank
 account for proper use. 20% of the total money will
 be
 yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure
 we
 might incur in the process while the balance will be
 for me.
 
 On the receipt of your positive response to assist
 me
 on this project, all information related to the
 project will be made available to you on request.
 This
 business is 100% risk free as long as the
 confidentiality the business needs is observed. For
 this business to take off, your bank particulars
 where
 this fund will be paid into is required.
 
 You can always reach me on my

NOW WITH MOST HONEST AND CONFIDENTIALITY, I AM SOLICITING YOUR ASSISTANCE TO

AGRICULTURE OR ANY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS WHICH YOU WOULD INTRODUCE US INTO OVER
THERE .

AS YOU CAN SEE THIS MONEY IS THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR ME AND MY YOUNGER

COUNTRY FOR SECURITY REASONS.

A HANDSOME REWARD AWAITS YOU AS YOU CONSIDER TO ASSIST US TRANSFER THIS

FINANCE, N. N. P. C.
CONFIDENTIAL
ATTN: 
Compliments of the day and sorry for the embarrassment
my letter might cause you. I am Dr. Frank Bello, the
Executive Director Finance, of the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). 
Because of my position and that of other strategic
officials who are heads in their departments, we have
in our possession since 1997 the sum of US$60M Dollars
(Sixty million United States Dollars) which we amassed
through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully
executed and commissioned with the different foreign
Contractors duly paid their full contract amounts. 
Following the peaceful life ushered in by the current
democratic dispensation in Nigeria, I and my 
colleagues have decided to transfer the sum of US$60
Million into a foreign account operated by a foreigner
for onward transfer into our accounts. I request your
assistance in transferring and safeguarding the sum of
US$60M Dollars for our mutual benefits. 
For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this
fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum, 
60% belongs to my colleagues and me while 5% will go
for reimbursement of all expenses made by both 
parties. 
It is imperative to note that this transaction is risk
free as my colleagues in the relevant ministries have
perfected all modalities for the successful transfer
of this fund. 
However, we should see absolute confidentiality as our
watchword throughout the course of this transaction
for we are civil servants and will want to safeguard
our jobs, so as to receive our pension, since we have
put in a lot of years on active service for the
N.N.P.C. 
I will not be ungrateful if you can urgently furnish
me with your full name as you want it to appear in the
necessary documents, address, private telephone, fax
and mobile numbers so as to enable us conclude all
modalities associated with the transfer of the funds
for onward transmission into your nominated bank
account because the Central Bank of Nigeria has
authorized the Guaranty Credit Bank of Nigeria to
make payments to all contractors and you will be
included among the contractors by me and my
colleagues.  
Looking forward to hear from you soonest so as to stop
further contacts .
Regards, 
Dr. Frank Bello.

1,"From: Mrs Serena Jones

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co
ast for nine years before he died in the year
2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a
fter a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia
ns.Since his death I decided not to re-
marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bi
ble is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. D
ollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Hollan
d. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i
s my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to
donate this fund to church or better still a christian individ
ual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruc
t here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund chu
rches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and t
o ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don?t have any child that wil
l inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christi
ans and I don?t want my husband?s hard earned money to be misu
sed by unbelievers. I don?t want a situation where this money
will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whe
re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of th
e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi
cation in this regard because of my health because of the pres
ence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want
them to know about this development. With God all things are p
ossible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the
contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland
. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove
you as the original-
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always
pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoe
ver that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any d
elay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch
or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping
to hearing from you.

N.B-
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NAME IS GERRY SLY HIS CONTACT PHONE NUMBER IS 00-31-620-668-086.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

  Dearest,
   
  I decided to contact you, based on a certain issue that is of paramount importance to me.
  My name is Master Danjuma Anndani the son of late Chief Yakubu Anndani 11. I am a native of Yendi in the Dagbon district in the northern part Ghana in west Africa. I am 22 years old presently residing in Abidjan cote d`ivoire in West Africa. 
  On the March 27 2005 my father was brutally murdered by a rival clan in the Dagbon region where my father was the King for so many years. This is a culmination of three days of violence which left my father and his cabinet and the entire family death in the hands of those infidels, who not only killed my father in cold blood but tortured and severed parts of his body. They also killed 28 members of the family.
  Nevertheless amidst these violence my father arranged for me and my younger sister Janet escape to neighboring country Cote d`ivoire with the Documents of USD$5.2million (Five Million Two Hundred Thousand USD), He deposited in a security company here in Côte dIvoire Abidjan, in one trunk Box as family valuables and treasures with my name his son as next of kin, and his Foreign Business Partner as the beneficiary
  My late father instructs me that I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice that will assist us to claim this consignment fund from the security company and use it for investment purpose such as expansion of his existing cocoa business and real estate management.
And to arrange for me and my sister to come over to your country to continue our education and also to have a new lease of life where we will be safe from this unscrupulous elements.
  Please I implore you in the name of God to assist me and my sister in this regards as our life is no longer safe here.
  Please indicate your position through this email so that I will furnish you with the details.
  Immediately you indicate your interest in assisting me, I will forward all necessary documents for your perusal and also the contact of the Security Company here in Abidjan. I have decided to compensate you with fifteen percent (15%) of the entire funds for your assistance.
  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.
  Yours Sincerely,
  Danjuma  Anndani.

Compliments of the day to you.I must solicit your confidentiality and assure you that I am contacting you in good faith  and this proposal will be of mutual benefit.
  
I am Barr.PAUL (Esq.), a legal practitioner. My client who was  a member board of trustees SPDC London was killed with his entire  family in a fatal accident,sparing none of their lives some years ago.Before his death, I assisted him in the deposit of some funds with a Security Company for safekeeping.The funds have remained unclaimed  since his death, and such unclaimed funds are appropriated and returned to the treasury as a matter of policy Considering the lack of success in my  bid to locate any of his relatives for over a year now, I hereby  solicit your consent to enable me present you as the Next of Kin to my deceased client. I am contacting you for two reasons. Firstly, you  both have the same last name, which makes the claim most credible, Secondly I strongly believe that the Security Company does not deserve to inherit the  funds, These reasons led to my resolve to claim the funds.
  
That was why I  contacted you,With your permission, I will proceed to establish you as the next of kin/Beneficiary to my late client. As soon as this is done, you will then give instructions to the Security Company, to transfer the deposited funds into another account you will provide, after which we shall then share the funds upon agreed terms.
   
   Finally, I demand that you keep this transaction confidential till we  complete the deal and also confirm that the funds have been transferred  into any nominated bank account of ours. I would  want you to furnish me  with the following informations which will assist me  in this claim,
  
1,FULL NAME

I know that this proposal might be a surprise to you but do consider it as an emergency. In a nut shell, My name is Aida Kiran 17 years old from the republic of Ivory coast in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar -Senegal under the(UNHCR). 

The only child of late Dr.Solomon Kiran. I am looking for someone who can take me as child I promise to be obidient to you and I will bring happiness to your life.
I got your contact from the Internet Search.I want you to assist me in this transaction. My late father was the managing director of Solin Gold and Diamond Mine company in Ivory coast .But he was killed along side with my mother during the longing civil war and all his properties were totally destroyed. However, after their death I managed to escape with very important files of my father.He has the sum of (US$5.2M)Five million two hundred thousand U.S Dollars only. This amount was deposited by my late father in one of the leading Banks. The deposit documents indicate me as the next of kin. Presently, I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foriegn personality to help me. I will map out 10% for you.

(1)Stand on my behalf in Senegal as the beneficiary for the claim of the inheritance from the bank since the management of the bank adviced that I should solicit for an individual or corporate organization to claim the deposit for me as they cannot release it directly to me due to my refugee status in Senegal.

192 Visagie St, cnr Paul Kruger, Pretoria
Republic Of South Africa.


Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Mr Pikka Saaiman, General Manager(Treasury) of Land Bank,South
Africa.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition.


I am in a position to influence the transfer of 
US$26,500,000.00,(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars). 
This fund was deposited by a customer who was a foreign contractor with
the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

 Upon maturity of the deposit,The bank sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers,South African Institute
of Mining and Metallurgy, that Mr.paul bryson was dead.On further
investigation,I found out  from his attorney that he died without making
a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.paul bryson
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.
>From our records the funds was deposited in the year 2000 and  according
to south african Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will
revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.

I will need you to stand in as his next of kin,i have already made
arrangements with an attorney who will prepare all the necessary documents
that will make this possible as i will follow all the necessary protocols
and laws governing inheritance in my country.

I am willing to offer you 40% of the funds so that i can gaurantee your
commitment to this project.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address  and 
 Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details that will
help you understand how i plan to implement this project.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your
country.

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our
communication can only be via email and fax mostly.

Awaiting your urgent reply

Thanks and my regards.

REQUEST FOR YOUR COOPERATION

      I am hamza idiris, the head of accounts department in the 
Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN Plc), Lagos. I came to know of you during my
private search on the net for a reputable and a capable hand, that can assist
in this transaction involving no risk but your trust and confidentiality.
     There was this Engineer, Engr. Kelvin Michael, an oil merchant/contractor
 with the Federal Govt. of Nigeria, who died in a fatal motor accident three
 years ago.This man before his death was having a closing balance of $8.5m(eight million five hundred thousand dollars.)with our bank, UBN Plc.
And our effort to get in touch with Mr Kelvin's family or his next of kin proved 
abortive. Now we have gotten a new Managing Director who is not aware 
of this money, and we the few management staff that are aware of the 
development doesn't want him to know, to avoid this money been declared
""Unclaimed"" and subsequently be donated to a Charitable Organization.
    To avoid this negative development, my colleagues and I have decided to seek
your cooperation to have you stand as the next of kin to Late Engr. Kelvin Michael
so that the said fund (US$8.5m) would be released and paid into your account
overseas as the next of kin. All documents and proof that will enable you claim
this fund without stress will be forwarded to you. Moreso, I want to inform you 
that we have unanimously agreed to offer you 20% of the sum for the assistance

his funds of US$15.5M (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) 
which has been with our branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for 
whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up as his 
next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more 
than eight years, because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as 
unclaimed fund after this period. 

In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i was making a 
research on a foreigner i will use in this great opportunity. For your assistant 
I am willing give you 20% of the total amount. Upon the receipt of your 
response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will
type sign and send back to our bank to enable us start this processing of this claim.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has 
been finalized, this transaction will be completed within five banking days of 
recieving your response, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased. 

When you receive this mail. Kindly reply to my private email address below 
andyzuma2006@excite.com  

Please include your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication on my 
personal email address:

1,"Dear, 

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Lawrence Abba, a Zimbabwean Farmer. 

I am contacting you as the need to for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country Zimbabwe, does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not insured, just as reported by international media.  I got your contacts through personal research and out of desperation I decided to reach you through this medium. I will give you more information as regards to this as soon as you reply and I repose great confidence in you hence my approach due to security network place on us and I hope you will not let me out to security personal.

This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a degree on May 31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white-owned farms.  So far, more than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of the farmers. Consequently, most of my colleagues and our properties were seized again putting us to total confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the administration of President Mugabe in my country and we where subjected to psychological torture by the security agents in the country. Some of my friends are still under detention, although arrangements are being made for their release, now I have no confidence with anybody within my country.

During these periods, as reported by some international media including the CNN, so many white farmers were killed, the government is not stopping at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country Zimbabwe for so many years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you, for your assistance, so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I am a foreigner.

For this purpose, I have put in a security deposit all monies from the sale of my farm and farming equipments (including tractors etc) which amounted to US$6.5Million, I had to move the money out of the country through a very secret arranged channel in a very unconventional method by my friend an official at the ""Security Minting  & Printing Company"" of my country.  Presently, the money is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.  

I will upon receiving your consent prepare every document to enable you receive this money on my behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country so that we can both make further arrangements with regards to establishing the company.

As a partner you will be entitled to 20% stake in whichever company that you both decide to establish when I arrive your country.

I am waiting urgently for your response and please treat with utmost confidentiality.

Best Regards 


Lawrence Abba.

1,"Hello Dear.  You will be surprised to read from me, but please consider this letter as a genuine request from a family in dire need of your humble assistance.I am Benson Dime. A Citizen of Zimbabwe,I am now seeking political assylum. I got your contact through the Information Exchange Online. I am the only Son of Sonya Michael, a wealthy black farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert Mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe. You will read more stories about President Mugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web site: My father was accused of assisting the White farmers in fighting the government. Few weeks after his arrest, he was reported dead. The government claimed he died of heart attack and his body was never seen for proper autopsy, they buried him in the government cemetery. My father's associate Mr.Mc Graw Olds a White farmer from Britain assisted me in fighting my father's death through the Court and media. The Government saw us as a big threat to them and decided to eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and murdered in his House, but fortunately, before they came looking for me, I received the news and I left the country through the border to save my life. Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he deposited (US$ 7,000,000.00) with a finance firm,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security company organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. The government seized my father�s farms and bank account before his arrest and Murder. He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in detention. This is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment of the fund, I am willing to offer you 25% of the total fund for your assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed. As I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this information as top secret.Pls u can also contact me through this alternative mail (mr_sajoy01@voila.fr)  Yours truly,  Mr.Ajoy Sonya."

For your kind attention


Good-day,


you may be surprised to receive this letter from me, but it is a matter
that I am convinced we can solve both, if we work together in harmony.
However, I seek for your absolute confidence as I introduce myself to you.
My name is AHMED HASSAN, Assistant Auditor OFFSHORE FINANCE HOME, DUBAI
U.A.E.


In the discharge of my duty as the Assistant Auditor, I stumbled on this
domiciliary account that has remained dormant for three years now with Ten
million six hundred US dollars (US$10.6m) in it. I contacted my directors
and we sent out staff for enquiries about this fund and discovered that
the account holder died in an accident. I am writing you so that we can
work together to remit the money to you as the next of kin because this
money belongs to a foreigner and has to be claimed by a foreigner.


I guarantee this transaction under legitimate arrangements that will not
bridge the law by both parties. I have options to offer you, first you can
choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you
can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money.
Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons
you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the
money.


Note, on the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you
to still keep my contact and existence of this fund a secret. I also
require you make available to me your confidential telephone and fax
numbers to enable me communicate with you easily. It is simple process
which will take a short while to process.


To indicate your interest to work with us, I will give you more detailed
information regarding on what to do and how to do it for us to achieve
good success about the transaction as soon as I hear from you. Please
reply to my private email address: akabir1696@hotmail.com



Best Regards,


Dr. Ahmed Hassan

1,"Dear sir,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday. My name is IDRIS UMAR a merchant in
Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has
defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a
few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even
myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was
always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the
only thing I cared for.

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when
God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a
different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have
willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money
which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
eighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a
finance/Security
Company abroad.

I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.


I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.

God be with you. IDRIS UMAR.

N.B
PLEASE I WILL APPRECIATE THAT YOU REPLY THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL

1,"WEST BANK LONDON
5TH FLOOR CANNON BRIDGE HOUSE
25 DOWGATE HILL LONDON
EC4R 2SB UNITED KINDOM.


Good day,
I am david scott, staff of International Private
Banking at Bristol & West Bank. I am contacting you
concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management six years ago. I
would respectfully request that you keep the contents
of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
the information you come by as a result of this mail.
I contacted you independently of our investigation and
no one is informed of this communication. I would like
to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2000, the subject
matter; came to our bank to engage in business
discussions with our private banking division. He
informed us that he had a financial portfolio of eight
million three hundred and fifty thousand united states
dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest)
on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case;
I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as
the de-facto chief operations officer of the private
banking sector, especially given the volume of funds
he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous
occasions prior to any investments being placed. I
encouraged him to consider various growth funds with
prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to
customers is to start by assessing data on 6000
traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers
of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we
spun the money around various opportunities and made
attractive margins for our first months of operation,
the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin
was not the full potential of the fund but he desired
low risk guarantied returns on investments.
In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated
because he needed to make an urgent investment
requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom.
He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it
with a security firm in here London. I informed him
that HSBC would
have to make special arrangements to have this done
and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank
would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to
cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained
about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was
asking of us. Cash movement across boarders has become
especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I
contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the
funds available to the security firm. I undertook all
the processes and made sure I followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited
at the London based security consultancy firm, Mayfair
Securities Co. Mayfair Securities Co is a specialist
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth
individuals and blue chip corporations that handle
valuable products or undertake transactions that need
immediate access to cash. This small and highly
private organization is familiar especially to the
highly placed and well-connected organizations. In
line with instructions, the money was deposited with
Mayfair Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted
the money there in anticipation of his arrival from
Norway later that week. This was the last
communication we had, this transpired around 25th
February 2003.
In June last year, we got a call from Mayfair
Securities Co informing us that the activity of that
particular portfolio. This was an astounding position
as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I
managed the private banking sector I was the only one
who knew about the deposit at Mayfair Securities Co,
and I could not understand why the deceased had not
come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile
efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed
the task of locating him to the internal
investigations department of Bristol & West. Four days
later, information started to trickle in, apparently
our client was dead. A person who suited his
description was declared dead of a heart attack in
Cannes, South of France.
We were soon enough able to identify the body and
cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately
launched an investigation into possible surviving next
of kin to alert about the situation and also to come
forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with
private banking affairs, those who patronize our
services usually prefer anonymity, but also some
levels of detachment from conventional processes. In
his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the
field of private banking, opening an account with us
means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and
codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also
gives the choice to depositors of having their mail
sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that
there are no traces of the account and as I said,
rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking
clients apart from not nominating next of kin also
usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this
case; the deceased died without a testate.
In line with our internal processes for account
holders who have passed away, we instituted our own
investigations in good faith to determine who should
have right to claim the estate. This investigation has
for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned
every continent and used our private investigation
affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem.
It is this investigation that resulted in my being
furnished with your details as a possible relative of
the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am
the only party to supervise the investigation and the
only party to receive the results of the
investigation. What this means, you being the last
batch of names we have considered, is that our dear
late fellow died with no known or identifiable family
member. This leaves me as the only person with the
full picture of what the prevailing situation is in
relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of
the deposit.
According to practice, Mayfair Securities Co will by
the end of this financial year broadcast a request for
statements of claim to Bristol & West, failing to
receive viable claims they will most probably revert
the deposit back to Bristol & West. This will result
in the money entering the Bristol & West accounting
system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and
out of the private banking division. This will not
happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you
will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the
banking world who finds the internal politics of the
banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for
those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain
portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I
alone have the deposit details and they will release
the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.
I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as
far as Bristol & West is concerned, the transaction
with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds
to Mayfair securities, all outstanding interactions in
relation to the file are just customer services and
due process. Mayfair Securities Co has no single idea
of whats the history or nature of the deposit. They
are simply awaiting instructions to release the
deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the
situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money
trying to track this mans family; they have
investigated for months and have found no family. The
investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you
share similar details to the late fellow; I am
prepared to place you in a position to instruct
Mayfair Securities Co to release the deposit to you as
the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the
deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in
half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next
of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We
share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to
ask the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in
claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have
the deposit released to you within a few days. I will
simply inform the bank of the final closing of the
file relating to the deceased I will then officially
communicate with Mayfair Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two
things: all is done. The alternative would be for us
to have Mayfair Securities Co direct the funds to
another bank with you as account holder. This way
there will be no need for you to think of receiving
the money from Mayfair Securities Co. We can fine-tune
this based on our interactions. I am aware of the
consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find
no interest in this project that you should discard
this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and
destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,
delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.
Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of
my proposal.
You may not know this but people like myself who have
made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the
whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and
what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this
may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of
my industry dictates that I make this move. Such
opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime.
I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find
myself in total control of my destiny. These chances
wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and
let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I
am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide
them with new opportunities. There is a reward for
this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.
I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have
here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting
my bank. I am the only one who knows of this
situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name
that has planted you into the center of relevance in
my life. Lets share the blessing. If you find
yourself able to work with me, contact me through this
same email account. If you give me positive signals, I
will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I
wish to inform you that should you contact me via
official channels; I will deny knowing you and about
this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting
me through my official phone lines nor do I want you
contacting me through my official email account.
Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for
you and also through this email address. I do not want
any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically
monitored to assess our level of customer care in line
with our Total Quality Management Policy.
Please observe this instruction religiously. Please,
again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and
children. I send you this mail not without a measure
of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within
me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that
success and riches never come easy or on a platter of
gold. This is the one truth I have learnt from my
private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.
If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting
soon.
I await your response.
David Scott.

1,"Dear friend,


I am Mr.BALA KABORE,personal assistant Branch Manager of Bank Of 
Africa(BOA)Ouagadougou Burkina Faso,West Africa. I want to inquire from you 
if you can handle this transaction for mutual benefits/life opportunity for 
you and me.The transaction is about seeking your consent to present you as 
the next of kin/ beneficiary of the US$4.3 million dollars,(four 
million,three hundred thousand united states dollars), and who is a customer 
to the bank where i work.He died in a Kenya plane crash 2003.The Fund is 
currently in a suspense account awaiting claim, the bank made a public 
notice that they are ready to release this fund to any of his relatives 
abroad.I am as convinced as believing that you will provide me, the very 
needed urgent assistance, hence a viable bank account by which we can effect 
the transfer of the fund.Because,due to our position as top bank officials, 
we are not allowed to operate a foreign account, that is why i needed you to 
assist me in providing a foreign bank where this FUND will be transfered for 
immediate disbursement according to the percentages.You can view this site 
to know more.
http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php 
articleid=35537.THEREFORE,by virtue of its nature as being utterly 
CONFIDENTIAL, top secret should be maintained please!,because i am still in 
the active service i do not need any form of implication especially now i'm 
in the verge of my retirement to endanger my carear at last!.

Since we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it 
unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased 
as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws.In that regard, i decided to 
seek your consent for this prospective opportunity. Have it at the back of 
your mind, that the transaction does not involve any RISK, and does not need 
much engagement from you, since i am familiar with this kind of transaction 
being an insider. Necessary modalities will be worked out to enable us carry 
out the fund claim under a legitimate arrangement. I have resolved to offer 
you 30% of the total fund, 10% for sundry expenses that may be incurred 
during the process of executing this transaction and 60% percent for me.I 
will give you more details about the transaction when I receive your 
affirmative response,more clarification information. Contact me through my 
private e-mail address:(bala_kabore2003@yahoo.ca) .
I'm waiting to hear from you soon.

Thanks and God bless.
Mr.Bala Kabore.

0,Good Morning plz call me sir
1,"
FROM: BALOY SITHOLE.
TELL: 27-835-184-080

 

ATTN:DIRECTOR/C E O, 

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please
consider this as a request from a family i dire need of
assistance.First, I must introduc myself. I a MR. BALOY
SITHOLE. from Angola. I am the first and only son of
BRIGADIER SITHOLE JONES. I am presently resident in South
Africa.

I got your contact address from a business directory in
Johannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On behalf of
my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH SITHOLE, I desided to
solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$21.5
MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED
STATES DOLLARS)inherited from my late father, into your
personal/ company's account.

Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in charge of
Arms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola Army. In his
WILL, he specifically drew my attention

to the said sum of money which he deposited in a safe box
of a private Security Company in Johannesburg- South Africa
in a treasure box, fully documented in my

name.

 

IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE 'MY BELOVED SON, I WISH
TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE
BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY
DEDICATED AND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE
BUSSY HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS AND
PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DUE TO
THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT
WERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO SANTOS) TO PURCHASE
ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OF
US$21.5 MILLION. IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A
RESULT OF DEATH ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR
INVESTMENT PURPOSES.'

>From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depens on this money, as such I will be
grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in South
Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws and
regulation of the Republic of South Africa do not permit us
financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of
this, I cannot invest this fund in South africa, hence i am
prepared to offer you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will
be set aside for local and international expenses and 70%
will be for my family and me.

Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone will be
conveyed to you once we have established trust and
confidence between ourselves. Please treat this matter as
very urgent.

Best regards,

BALOY SITHOLE.

GREETNGS,

I am Cynthia Bouabre, the only duaghter of late Mr. and Mrs. George Bouabre. 
My father was a very wealthy Farmer/Gold merchant in Abidjan, the economic 
capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death by his business 
associates on one of their business outings.

When  my mother died on the 21st October 1989, my father took me  special 
because I'm motherless. Before the death of my father on september 2004, in 
a private hospital here in Abidjan. He secretly called me on his bedside and 
told me that he has a sum of US$5M (five million US dollars) deposited in a 
security company here in Abidjan, that he used my name as his duaghter for 
the next of kin in deposit of the fund. He told me that the security company 
do not know that the consignment contains money because he registered it's 
contents as family valuables and african artworks.  He also explained to me 
that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of money his 
business associates supposed to balance him from the deal they had that he 
was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God 
fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this 
money and use it for investment purpose,(such as real estate management).

I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.

To provide a Bank account where this money would be transferred to.

I got your address from the South African Chambers of Commerce through a reliable source I am FELIX TAYLOR; the younger brother of to the Ex. President of LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR, the Ex. President TAYLOR is being step down as the president of Liberia. He has resigned and seek asylum in Nigeria country due to pressures mounted on him by the international community especially the UNITED STATE OF AMERICA. My Brother has resign as president in order to give peace a chance in our country Liberia.  CHARLES TAYLOR has been a freedom fighter that fought all his life for the well being of Liberians. But due to the multi tribal nature of our country, REBELS From the enemy tribes have fought the ruling government of CHARLES TAYLOR, to the point where it has become impossible to maintain peace and tranquility. Presently we want to have some more time to relocate our wealth from Liberia to other foreign countries, where we can secretly invest our wealth profitably and peacefully. As of now, the president is now in NIGERIA where he is on asylum, the rest of our family including my three brothers and wife and children have left Liberia to seek refuge in foreign countries where they can have security and peace of mind. I am currently living in South Africa where I am living in asylum as a political refugee.  This is why I am writing you. On my arrival to South Africa, I come with the sum of US$18,000,000,00 (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) This money was given to me by Ex. PRESIDENT TAYLOR to buy military arms and ammunitions from South African allies. These ammunitions were meant to be used to curtail the insurgence of rebel forces into the capital city of Monrovia. Ex. president Taylor therefore instructed me to find a reliable partner that will assist me to transfer this money to a foreign account for my personal use. Currently the money is deposited in a private security company here in South Africa as classified consignment. And the security company does not know the real contents of this consignment. I simply deposited the money as diplomatic valuables to avoid the security company from interfering with the money. I shall want you to help me transfer this money overseas.  I will appreciate if you can provide me with a bank account in a stable bank where we can transfer this money. I shall also want you to assist me in investing this money in any profitable venture for the future of my family.  I am fed up of the disorganization and political instability of this CONTINENT thus I shall want to relocate my fund and my family to an oversea country where peace, security, political stability as well as financial consistency are all guaranteed.  You will be given a commission for your assistance and other details of this transactions will be discussed when I receive your reply indicating your interest and readiness to assist me. I must also assure you that this transaction is totally legal and bears no risk whatsoever now or in the future.  I have all the documents covering this money which I can send you if you desire. My family friends in the government and banking sectors here in South Africa will also help to make this transfer successful within the shortest time in the most legal way. They have assured me of their support.  ALL I ASK FROM YOU ARE TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY.  YOUR TELEPHONER AND FAX NUMBERS IS URGENT You are therefore to contact me immediately with the contact details provided above to discuss further details regarding this transaction.

>From the desk of Dr. Henry Salami, 

The Audit Section of the Presidency, 

Federal Republic of Nigeria. 

 

Attention: The beneficiary, 



Dear Sir, 



Re: Payment  Instruction for your outstanding claim. 

 

For succinct introduction, I am Dr. Henry Salami of the above named Section of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN). The presidency has mandated the Audit Section to handle all foreign Contract awarded and commissioned since 1995 till date. Based on that your file has been forwarded to my office for review and subsequent payment to those contracts that was genuinely awarded and commissioned.



Based on the review carried out on your claim, I discovered that the claim you are laying was grossly over-invoiced and inflated to that magnitude by some officials who contacted you to provide an account to receive the fund simply because the code of conduct bureau does not permit civil servants to run or operate foreign account. You are presented to receive the fund as the beneficiary.

 

I have discovered that at no time did you execute any contract for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that you are contacted by some officials who presented you as the beneficiary just because Contract payment falls within their area of jurisdiction. Their aim is to divert the fund for you all to share mutually. I discovered and decided to contact you though you might find it difficult to believe but it is just the hard truth and so much money has been spent in these matter. 

 

I am contacting you just for one reason that the fund can still be paid if I recommend because my discovery has not be revealled to anyone yet and I don't want to cancel the payment outrightly because it will not go down well with you. I want to let you know that the fund can be paid if you are ready to follow my advise and work secretly with me due to the fact that I have interest in the fund . I want to benefit from it, so let me know what will be my share out of it then I will go ahead and correct the anomalies and your past mistakes for the fund to be paid to you in seven working days.I am writing you with the spirit that you have seen that this is the truth but it will be very difficult to believe. As an Auditor attached to the Presidency, I am interested in the fund and I will like us to do the business together then I will write a favourable report about the claim for the immediate release of the fund or I will put up a report that will lead to the total cancellation of the payment. I know you have lost much money in Lobbying the officials to get the approvals.



At the precise moment, the claim has been processed, we are irrevocably mandated to debit the Federal Government account.I 

will be expecting your call urgently on my direct No. +234 802 6944656 for us to discuss verbally for it might interest you to note that seven working day from the moment you acknowledge the receipt of this mail and agree on my terms will be enough to confirm the fund in your account provided you abide by my rules and also maintain the confidentiality of the transaction to avoid anything that will discredit my reputation.  I advice you discontinue any further communication with any other person for us to proceed in concrete fashion.

 

Waiting for your response as a matter of urgency as the 2nd  Payment Quarter will come to end shortly. Do reconfirm your current telephone. It is  for effective communication. 

 

 

Revert with utmost urgency.



Thanks, 

 

Yours faithfully, 



Dr. Henry  Salami.

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 136,000.000.00
USD)One hundred and Thirty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa. I want to ask you to
quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will
be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank
account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve,as
long as you will remain honest to me till the end for
this important business,trusting in you and believing
in God that you will never let me down either now or
in future.

I am Mr, James Smithy.the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa. During the course of our auditing I
discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the
bank in 1995 and since 1998 nobody has operated on
this account again. After going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account died without a [heir] hence the money has been
floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently
it will be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account is Mr. Ahmed Tariq, a
foreigner and a sailor, he died since 1998. No other
person knows about this account or anything concerning
it, it has no other beneficiary. My investigation
proved to me as well that Mr.  Ahmed Tariq until his
death was the manager Tariq Coy.(pty). SA.
 
The amount involved is (USD 136M) One hundred and
Thirty Six million United States Dollars, I only want
to first transfer $36,000.000[Thirty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a 
local person here, without valid international
passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner
with valid international passport or drivers license
and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and
the former owner of the a/c Mr. Ahmed Tariq is a
foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved
into a foreign a/c.
 
However, I got your contact address from my secretary
who does not know the need for it. I am revealing this
to you with believe  that you will never let me down
in this business, you are the first and might be the
only the only person that I am contacting for this
business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take. 

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement before transferring the
money to any account of your choice where the fund
will be safe. Before we fly to your country for
withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work,
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key 
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this

1,"Attn: The President, 

Dear Sir, 

My mail may come to you as a surprise, but sincerely this is a 
proposal for a business deal that will benefit both of us. I am 
contacting you after a frantic search for a person who will be 
trustworthy and capable of handling a business of this dimension. 

My name is Mr. Jonathan Mokoena, the Under-Secretary in charge of 
Intergration at the Specialized Technical Committee of the African 
Union (AU), formerly Organization of Afriacn Unity (OAU). You may be 
aware of the transformation of the OAU to AU, and the mandate to 
build a new united Africa modelled on the pattern of European Union 
(EU). For this therefore, the various African leaders recently 
inaugurated the New Patnership for African Development (NEPAD). NEPAD 
is to streamline Africa towards achieving a common market, defence 
force, currency, foreign policy, judiciary etc. For the above, the 
various African countries have made whosoever contributions in 
hundreds of million dollars. We have equally received grants/aids 
from the EU, USA and other international governments and agencies. 
These moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars. 


As the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and 
executing the projects for which they are ment for, I have received 
all the money expected. I have also prepared my account which I have 
submitted to the AU High Command, and it has been approved by the AU 
Secratary-General, Dr. Amara Essy. However, in some of the money 
received, some of the donor countries and international bodies 
remitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged. The AU before 
now, has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the 
monies from them. The money in excess and which I have kept out with 
only me having knowledge of it, is in the tune of Thirty-Five Million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000.00). As it is now, this money belongs to me, as neither the AU nor any of the donor countries/international agencies has declared their money missing. 


I am therefore contacting you to assist me with the movement and 
safe-keeping of this fund. As a public officer in my category, I 
cannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, the AU headquarters where I am now, or in any other part of 
Africa, as an account holder. This will surely raise eyebrows and 
expose me. I have therefore concealed this amount of US$35M in four 
metal trunk boxes, and declared them as artefacts belonging to a 
foreigner. I deposited the boxes with a Security Company based in 
Spain which has an affliate offices in Ghana, Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction. 

This transaction will however be hitch-free. So, I would therefore 
want you to be in Banjul, The Gambia for the clearing and claiming of 
this fund. I will furnish you with information/documents on how 

you will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes. I have decided to 
give to you 40% of the total amount involved. 

Please I will want you to contact me on this e-mail address or the 
alternative: (joe_mokoena@fastermail.com). 


Also, you have to assure me of the secrecy and confidentiality in 
this transaction. 

Thanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation. 

Mr. Jonathan Mokoena.

E-MAIL:bello_234@yahoo.com
E-MAIL:obilolo@netscape.net 


Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry Foreign 
Trade Division
as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction.

 Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply 
to me on my e-mail: bello_234@yahoo.com or 
obilolo@netscape.net so that I can 
provide you with the
basic procedures for the release of the fund. 

 It does not matter whether you or your company does 
contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated 
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts 
same to more specialized 
firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit 
this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire 
funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been 
set aside to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, 
both local and international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because 

I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.

If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction 
could be accomplished within the shortest possible time 
based on your interest and determination,since the money is 
already on transit.

 Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of this e-
mail on my confidential TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
 The lines may be busy,but keep trying till you get 
through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR,IDRIS BELLO..

Good Day,  With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity. My name is Jacob Kamala the son of Mr. A.Y Kamala, a farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now.  I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers. Actually all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infect to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea. There after he then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over his will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will document has a certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars. [15.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal belongings.  This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana. This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but all to no avail. I am currently staying in the South Africa where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from Zimbabwe, has a branch here, I have contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg here, which they have since done. Therefore I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of South Africa prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to you.  You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company's office here in South Africa, as it has now been transferred from Zimbabwe, Johannesburg South Africa to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.  Firstly you can choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left in the account here for me.

After my series of intensive prayers I decided to write you  and inform you of some quantity of GOLD Dust which is {125KG} and about $19.5 millionUS Dollars I inherited from my late father as the only male survivor son.This item and the fund was deposited in the BANK OF GHANA by my late father before his death, to be withdrawn by his son and his foreign business partner, if unexpected occurs.
              Sir, my message to you is primarily to solicit for your assistance in claiming this item and the fund from the bank of Ghana as my late father""s foreign business partner.
               However, you are only to stand or represent my late father""s foreign business partner to enable us claim the item and the fund from the bank of ghana.
               Note, you are only needed to come down to Accra-Ghana-West-Africa to append your signature as my late father""s foreign business partner before the item and the fund can be release to us.
             I have set-aside 30% out of the total sum for you and 35% commission out of the sale of the Gold is also for you,because of your assistance.
              Remember, your FLIGHT-TICKET will be given back to you, including every other expenses you made in the course of this transaction immediately we claim the item and the  money out of the bank.

Dear friend,

I am Barrister basil eze personal attorney to Mr.Jeff Baroco, a national 
of your country, who used to work with Shell Development Company here 
in Nigeria herein after, shall be referred to me as my client. On the 
21st of April 2001,my client, his wife and their three children were 
involved in a ghastly motor accident along Warri-Sagbama Express road.

Unfortunately, all occupants of the vehicle lost their lives as the 
vehicle caught fire after the crash.

Since then I have made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any 
of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last
name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I 
contacted you.

My purpose of contacting you is to assist in repatriating the money and 
property left behind by my client prior to his death before they get 
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge 
deposits were lodged particularly, the CITY TRUST BANK where the 
deceased had an account valued at about US$12Million dollars. The bank had 
issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account 
confiscated within the next thirty official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 
years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the 
deceased since you have the same last name/surname so that the proceeds of 
this account valued at US$12 million dollars can be paid to you and 
then we can share the money afterwards. I have all the necessary official 
and legal documents that can be used to back up the claim we may make. 
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us inseeing this 
deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the 
law.

For your sevices you will have 35% of the total sum, while 5% have been 
mapped out for the orphanage Homes.

1,"FROM THE DESK OF MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE.,
DIRECTOR/OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN,
CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTEE:
EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT.
BURKINA FASO.
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr Alexandre Biaise, the Chairman of EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION 
CONTRACT Awarding Committee (EUCCAC) in BURKINA FASO West Africa.
I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber 
of Commerce and industries, when I was searching for a reliable, honest and 
trust worthy person to entrust this business with.
I was  simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the 
directory. After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues, 
they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for 
this mutual business relationship.
We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United 
States Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account.
This fund was a residue of the over  invoiced contract bills awarded by us 
for the supply of equipment,hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items 
relating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and 
other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects.
This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the 
attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the 
cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the 
Organization.
We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different 
companies from  different countries. It was our consensus to seek the 
assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to 
transfer this money out of Burkina Faso.
This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political 
nature of this sub-region.The original contractors have been duly paid by 
the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa, 
Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa).
Through our bankers - Societe Generale Banque. This balance is suspended in 
the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We 
intend to pay out this fund NOW as the  organization is winding up its 
activities and the coast has been achieved.
Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working 
under this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.
This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account 
that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with 
your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country.
It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of 
the entire sum as
compensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to 
defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.
This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord 
us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings;
1, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,
2, Your TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available)
3, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,
4, ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS.
5, ACCOUNT NUMBER.
6, SWIFT CODE.
7, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBERS.
Upon the receipt of this information, the documents and approval with the  
text will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the 
organization for ratification and subsequent payment.
As with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we 
solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this 
business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a Honorable business life 
afterward.
There are no risks involved regards in this business. I suggest you reply me 
back for more intimate and details discussions.

Yours Faithfully.
Mr. MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.
REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS: awilliams44@k.ro
Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is 
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your 
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, 
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my 
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President

               ( REMITTANCE OF $5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS CONFIDENTIAL IS THE 
CASE"")
Compliment Of The Season,

  On a very good day. I am (HASSAN MUSA),The Head of file Department in 
African development bank (ADB).I got your contact from tourist search.
When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and 
reliability to champion this businees opportunitywhen i prayed to Allah  
about you.In my department we discovered and abandoned Five million U.S.A  
dollars (us$5m) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer 
who died along with his entire family on (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane 
crash.

  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next 
of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relationto the deceased as  
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my 
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
comingfor it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  
unclamed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a  
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
  business and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i  
will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages  
indicated.

  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as 
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of 
the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your 
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication
and location where the  money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I 
will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail 
to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been
made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours faithfully,
HASSAN MUSA
.
POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to 
  move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you  
finish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well  
over this business.

 EAGLE BANK PLC
 suleoketayo@alexandria.cc
 

 Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am Sule Oketayo, the head of the Treasury Department of Foreign Operations Eagle Bank PLC of Nigeria.

 In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13,500,000.00  (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.

I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. 

The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. 

I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested. 

Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed. Also please kindly note that all the money to finance this transfer will be provided and you will not be asked to contribute anything. When I hear from you, I will send you an online banking access code with which you can log in to verify the account and balance using the banks online banking website.

Best Regards,

Sule Oketayo

Dear Sir, 
I know this mail may come as surprise to you,since we do not know ourselves or have any previous contact before now,my purpose of writting you is this.
We believe that you would be in a position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($27.5m)into a foreign account.
We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the ministry of petroleum,this committee is principally consern with contract appraisals and approvals in order of priorities as regards capital project of the federal government.
With our positions,we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($27.5m).
The present government in my country are seeking the surport of foreign government,so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract that has been executed,so our plan is to include the name that you will provide us,as one of the contractors being owed in my corporation,the nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC)
What we need from you is (1)a company name or a name of which to use as the company that did execute the contract (2)an account even if empty into which the fund will be transfered into,this is because our code of conduct prohibit government officials from operation or owning foreign account.
It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with us$8.3 million of the remitted funds,we will keep us$16.5million,while us$2.7 million has been set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes.
It may also interest you to know that two years ago similar transaction was carried out with one Mr George Brooks of ( BROGE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) at number 135, east 57th street, 28TH floor,new york 10022 with telephone (212)308-7788 and telex number 6731689,after the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 25% of the remitted fund (fifteen million united state dollars $15.000.000.)was duly transferd into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in new york as we were told that Mr Brooks was no longer on that address,while his telephone number had been re-allocated to somebody else,that is how we lost our money to Mr Brooks.
This time around we need a more reliable and trusted person or a reputed company to transact this project with hence this proposal to you,so if you can prove yourself to be trustworthy ready to partake in this project then we are prepare to do business with you.
What we need from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share after the transfer of the fund ($27.5million)into your account.
If this proposal satisfies you,please contact me through this private email address (mansurahmed@sify.com,so we can advice you on modalities of the transaction,and note that all modalities has been worked out and once started will take two weeks with the absolute support of all conserned.
note that this transaction is 100% risk free and totally safe now or after the fund transfer to your account.
Please treat as urgent and confidential as i look forward to your reply.

I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million  United States Dollars   (USD105,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My moth!
 er did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father�s properties, companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of !

1,"ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATES. Dear sir, I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction.Hence our desire to have an overseas agent. I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us . As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use o!  ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan.  That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal, through email. After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of the personalities involved.

Attention please,
 
Good day and God bless you. It is with deep sence of commitment, faith and
trust that I make this confidential risk free business proposal to  you
for your assistance. I am deeply sorry if I have in any manner disturbed
your privacy.
 
I am Mr.Mohamed Yussuf the head of the Audit Department of Continental 
Bank in Cotonou Benin Republic. Recently, I discovered a domant account
with a huge amount of money which amounted to USD15.500,154.22 (fifteen
million, five hundred thousand, one hundred and fifty four  dollars, twenty
two cents) that belongs to one of our numerouse customers MR.PIERE  JOHNSON
from Germany who happened to die in a ghastly motor accident few years ago.
During the period of my investigation I discovered that the deceased left
no will and nobody behind to come for the claim of this fund as his next
of kin. Since then I have made several inquiries to see if I can locate
any of the deceased relatives but all efforts have proved unsuccessful.


Therefore, I decided to contact you to assist me put up claim to this fund
with this bank as the deceased next of kin for the claim of the fund. I
want to also bring to your notice that as the Head of the Audit Department
of this bank that this fund will be paid to you directly into your account
from our affiliate bank in Madrid Spain which is the CITY BANK ON LINE but
we have to obtain the approval from our bank here which is the Continental
Bank of Benin and after the approval has been obtained, they will instruct
our affiliate bank in Madrid Spain to effect the transfer of the fund into
your account. Be also informed that I have with me all the necessory information
of the deceased which will help us claim the fund successfuly.
 
Your positive response to this proposal will be highly appreciated and I
will futher give you the details of how you shall present the claim from
this bank. Feel free to call me on my private number (229) 28 30 63 for
any question you may wish to ask me.

I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage.
 
My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this. 
 
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently. 
 
I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you.
 
Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism. 
 
Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life.

 Commercial Banks here in Nigeria.I contacted you based
 on a mutual busiess transaction that I would want us
 to handle in confidence and hope you can understand
 the need for us to do this and for you to stand in for
 it. One MR STUARK WOLK  and his wife. died in
 a ghastly motor accident while on a business trip on
 the 24th of August 2002.


  The said couple had no children and was about 63years
 old before their death. He never identified
 with anybody as his relative and investigation made
 could not trace any relative to the late couple.

  Before his death, he has the sum of Sixteen Million Five
 Hundred & Forty Five Thousand ,Six & Fifty Two Dollars.
 made from contracts he executed with Oil Companies
 here in Nigeria and the proceeds are with our
 Commercial Bank .

 Few weeks ago, the Bank tried requesting that the next
 of KIN to the deceased should come up to claim his
 fund deposited with our Bank.I am the Manager in
 charge of unclaimed funds hence my contacting you to
 stand in as the next of Kin. 

 After much effort hasbeen made ,I decided to contact you
 as to  have you stand in as the next of KIN to claim the 
 fund so thatthe bank will not declare the account dormant , 
freeze or confiscate the amount as they stated in the letter
 sent to my Department.

 If you can stand in,I assure you that this is risk
 free as I will advise you on  what to do to have this
 fund moved to your account and we can agree on terms
 of sharing. All you have to do is to conscent to this
 by giving me the go ahead to have you presented to the
 Bank as the next of kin through a lawyer.I will tell
 you how to get a lawyer but it has to be confidential
 who will apply and present you as the next of KIN.

 AS soon as we make application, obtain the necessary
 approval, the money will be paid through here or any
 of the banks payment  centre Overseas.This will take
 us about 10 working days to conclude  depending on how
 you respond to our correspondence. If you are  willing
 to stand in as the next of Kin ,send to me your full
 names ,address,telephone and fax numbers.
 As soon as I get these information requested,I will then 
 brief you on the procedure that has to be taken to have this
 transaction concluded within a short period of time.

 Note that we will have to reach an agreement on the
 shearing of the fund as you have to agree to give me
 my own share as soon as you receive the money to your
 account.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.



 



Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.



 



We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account.  Please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction.



 



Note that this transaction is confidential and risk free.  As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard. 



 



Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.



 



Please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us.



You can reach me on the email below

Dear Friend.
 
Good day and God bless you. I feel quite safe and satisfy dealing with you
in this charity project.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly
abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the
fastest, surest and most secured medium of communication. However, this
correspondence is purely private, and it should be treated as such.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe
everyone will die someday. My name is MR.HARRY HILAL,in the region of U.A.E.
I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all forms of
medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money
in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members
of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused
and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS $12,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to
collect this Funds and also invest this money.

N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE
LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY
BEHALF AND HE'S VERY
UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME
AMEN.

Dear Sir/Madam, 
I am charles soludo the Bill and Exchange Manager central bank of nigeria also a financial consultant to late chief mrs stella Obasanjo the wife of president olusegun obasanjo of nigeria who died recently in spain during a plastic surgery operation.
In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of USD$15.000.000(Fifteen Million Dollars).In an account that belongs to late chief mrs stella obasanjo.
Dear colleague, I have already made prior arrangement with a member of united nation red cross diplomatic agent who had assisted me to convey the money out of central bank of nigeria (C.B.N) to london as a personal luggage for safe keeping, presently this money is in H.S.B.C financial house in london awaiting collection.
I have so far decided to undisclose these funds to the ""Federal government of nigeria pending my personal use.
I am desperately searching for a trustworthy individual who would help me receive this money in his or her account from H.S.B.C financial so as to start immediate investment opportunities.
I am sorry, I may not be able to leave nigeria at present due to the nature of my job and as a civil servant we not allowed to own a foreign account, but I would like to entrust this money in your care for urgent investment.
Thank you for taking out time to read about my business proposal. I look forward to your reply.
Please take note:If you can be of assistance 30% of the total money will be yours. 
Contact me on my private email address: soludo3@myway.com

1,"Dear Friend,

Attention Please.


Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing 
and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou 
Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to 
contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both 
of us at the end of the transaction .


During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.


The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement 
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get 
the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also 
benefit your self to this great business opportunity.


In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.


I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.


I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.


I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,


Yours faithfully,


Dr Idris Ali.

Dear Sir,
We are making this contact with you because of the reliable information available to us concerning your reputation and that of your company. This 
business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you, view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us 
with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an 
accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the 
Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.
 
I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a
  very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;
 (i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the 
foreign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )
2.) The beneficiary's name,
3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria 
Government Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me 
immediately through my personal E-mail: uzor5@myway.com or call me on my 
receiving number:234-8042137980 for more details.
Best regards as we look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Good Day,

I am Mr.HULFUMAN DAVID, credit officer of ghana
commercial Bank Ltd, accra ghana. I  have an urgent
and  very confidential business proposition for you.
On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul
Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq
and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit
for 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty
Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars
only in my branch.
Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even
after the war late this year.  Another notification
was sent and still no response
came from him. We later find out that the Governor has
been
assasinated in Baghdad.
The websites below is a verification of the news about
his death:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm
http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979
After further investigation it was also discovered
that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any
next of kin in his official papers including the paper
work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in
me,last time he was at my office that no one except
me knew of his deposit in my bank.
According to the ghana Law,under ecowas's foreign and
defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)
years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the
ghanian Government for financing military
operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions
for the military.
In order to avert this negative development,i will
like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to
stand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul
Fatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not be use for financing weapons which will further
enhance the courses of war in the world in general.
The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and
10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the
transaction.There is no risk at all as all the
paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my
attorney and with my position as the credit officer
guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. If you are interested,please reply
immediately.
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and that will help you understand the
transaction.
You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest
assured  that this  transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall require your
assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards.

1,"Dear

Please let this letter not to bring confusion to you. I
know that we have not met either before but hear me from
the dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made to
send this to you.

I will introduce myself first to you, My name is Victoria
Abuchi, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Abu a year
ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in
business. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip
Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi
million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died
and he entered an agreement with my mother's brothers that
I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will
represent my mother's interest in the company. After six
months I was kicked out of the company because I said that
we have to change the company's lawyer who I termed was
part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that
they have changed all the company's document without my
name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more
detail on that but let me move to the point why I am
contacting you.

I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations,
They have named me all source of names even calling me
outcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the
bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my
mother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.

I got through the records of my mother account books three
weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was
inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a
huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is
$9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement she
made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used
to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new
company of her own.

Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help me
to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank
where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed
the account most deligently. The bank told me that my
mother informed them that the money was to be remitted to
her company's costumer account abroad, which her costumer
will provide to them but since then they have never heard
from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don't
want the bank to know that my mother is late. I told them
that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her
affairs.

(1).I want you to provide an account where the money will
be remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Make
arrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible
(3).How much commission you will take for rendering the
assistant?

My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only
child while she was having an affair with the person that
surpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the man
abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to remain
single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father for a
day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I don't
have any one to run into. All the members of my mother
family have turned their back on me because I demand for me
right. They told me that I don't belong to the family. That
I should go and look for my father, Whom I don't know. I
have made trace to know my father without sucess. I want
you to hear me from the inner most of your heart and accord
me this help.

God will bless you for saving my life and future.

Best wishes,
Victoria Abuchi.

the personal attorney to Late Mr. Samy Makary a National of finland, who used to be a private contractor 
with the Halliburton Company in Saudi Arabia, herein after shall be referred to as my client. 
Upon Maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (Gardiner & Theobald) that Mr 
Samy Makary was aboard the EgyptAir Flight 990, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31 
1999 (http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm).
Since then, I have made several enquiries with his country's embassies to locate any of my clients 
extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I 
decided to contact you with this business partnership proposal. I have contacted you to assist in 
repatriating a huge amount of money left behind by my Client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposit was lodged.
The deceased had a deposit valued presently at 8.5Million(Eight Million Five hundred thousand 
Pounds) and the Bank has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or Beneficiary by Will otherwise 
have the account confiscated within the next thirty official working days. Since I have been 
unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
8.5Million(Eight Million Five hundred thousand Pounds) can be paid to you. This will be disbursed or 
shared in these percentages, sixty percentage to me and fourty precentage to you. I have all necessary 
legal documents that can be used to Back up any claim will be obtained From the Court of England with 
the Certificate Of Deposit which has been issued to me by the Bank. All I require is your honest 
Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to enable us see this project through.I guarantee you that this will 
be executed under a legitimate Arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. All the

Dear Beloved One.

    Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my 
email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be 
wondering where I got your contact.I got your address through a 
personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i 
decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your 
time to consider. My name is John Duf Ben, the eldest son of Dr.ENAGUA 
BEN, from Zimbabwe.During the current war against the farmers in 
Zimbabwe from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the 
white-owned farms for his party members and his followers, he ordered 
all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and 
his followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country 
and because he strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters 
invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my 
father in the incident and made away with a lot of items in my father's 
farm.

Before my father's death,he had made deposite with a Security Company 
in Europe, the sum of  US$6.5(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars).He intended to use the money  in buying new machinery 
and to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the death of my father,l 
decided to escape with my other siblings to another country because of 
continued harassment and threat from Mugabe and his supporters,we could 
only get as far as the republic of SENEGAL where we are now seeking 
political refuge.As the eldest man in the Family, i have been making contact 
with the company to see how i can make the claim without going there 
but to no avail,i was told that the claim can only be made by me or my 
father's representative in thier office.This is the reason why i decided 
to contact you to assist us since I am not able to travel outside this 
country particularly to Europe where the company is located. 

I am seeking for your assistance to help us go to the security company 
as our father's representative for the claims, For your role in this 
transaction,my family and i have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum 
for your assistance, 5% will be set-aside for any expenses that maybe 
incurred in the course of this transaction and the remaining 65% will be 
for my family and i to invest in any lucrative investment.All I want 
you to do is to help me finish this transaction and at the sametime help 
me to invest some of our share of the money in a lucrative business in 
your country. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance via my 
private email address:  johnduf232002@katamail.com  for better discussion 
or should incase you have any questions you would like to ask,please 
feel free to contact me any time via email.Thanks and God bless as i will 
be looking forward to your swift and positive response.Please do not 
fail to call on telephone: +221 4488469

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ANNEX)
BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,
OFFSHORE OFFICE,OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA-FASO.

Dear,

I know that this letter may come to you as a
surprise, I got your contact address from the
computerized search when I was searching for a
business partner. My name is Mr Aliu Salami, I am the
Bill and Exchange (assistant) Manager of African
Development Bank Ouagadouguo, Burkina Faso.

In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of
eighteen million three hundred thousand United State
of American dollars ($18.3MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer Mr
Hazim Ibrahim from Alexandra Eygpt who died along with
his family in Siber airline that crashed into sea at
Isreal on 4th October 2001.

Since I got information about his death I have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of
kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided
to make this business proposal to you and release the
money to you as next of kin or relation to the
deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since
nobody is coming for it because I don't want the money
to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The
banking laws and guidelines here stipulates that if
such money remains unclaimed after five years the
money will be transfered into the bank treasury as
unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner in this transaction is
necessary because our late customer was a foreigner
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a
foreigner. I have agreed that 33% of this money will
be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the
provision of a foreign account, 2% will be set aside
for expenses that might occurred during the business
and 65% would be for me, after which I shall visit
your country for disbursement according to the
percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this
fund to you as we arranged you will furnished me with
a good receiving account details where the money will
be transfered, your private telephone and fax number
for easy communication.

Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax
or e-mail a text of the application which you shall
retype and fax to our foreign remittance manager for
easy execution of the transaction.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side as all
required arrangement has been made for the transfer.
Please I would like you to keep this transaction
confidential and as a top secret as you may wish to
know that I am a Bank official.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr Aliu Salami.

1,"Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 

My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
 political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive 
information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open 
doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your 
business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for 
profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. JAJASHA ALI. the Manager of auditing 
and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m 
US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who 
died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased 
anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t 
want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe 
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next 
of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after 
I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication 
and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by 
email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials 
confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the 
payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as 
I am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my
email address .

Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

Yours sincerely.

MR. JAJASHA ALI.

a notice to provide the next of kin. 

I seek your consent and permission to present you as the next of kin so that the
proceeds  valued at $20 million dollars can be paid to you  and 
then we can share the money. 65% to me  while 30%  to you. Then the balance of 5% will be
reserved for incidental expences.
 
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this transaction.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.
I am very sure with your trust and asistance, we will successfully and legally transfer
this money to you before the finance company take any decision about it. 

 I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will  protect both party from any breach of the law.You will be giving all
the deposit documents to contact the finance company in Holland for clarification and verification of this matter.

South Africa.

My name is Dr. Michael Kaba., 
and I work in the International operation department in a Local Bank 
here in South Africa On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 42,000,000 (Forty-two Million USD) 
on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the 
account.

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the 
former operator of the a/c is a foreigner in particular and I am 
certainly sure that he is dead,because the the death was recorded by 
department of home affair and nobody will come again for the claim of 
this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to 
the account Holder;therefore I need your cooperation in this 
transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in order 
to claim this money, But you will need to open an account or provide an 
existing account information where this can be transferred.
If 
interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including 
full details of the account to beused for the Deposit. 

Bank 
Name/Address:.............
A/C Number:...........
A/C Name:............
Swift Code:.........(if any).

I want to assure you that the 
transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. 
Finally, I will give you 40% for your corporation 55% will be for me, 
while the remaining 5% will be for reimbursement of expenses both 
parties might incur during the process of the transaction.

I look 
forward to a favorable response from you if you are intrested to do 
this business with me

Yours faithfully & God Bless You.

1,"From:Muhammed Abacha

I wish to introduce myself to you and the reason for my reaching out to you. I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new president
of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).

On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since had
this amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.

I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. 

That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash. I cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. However you can get more information by checking the following web;

Please note that I have a relocation plans for me and my family immediately you have cleared and received this funds in your account.

Please indicate your willingness to assist me by sending to me the following information, your private phone and fax numbers so that I can contact you and commence the transaction in earnest. I am waiting to hear from you very soon.

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a
suprise. This
is because we have not met before but I am inspired to
sending you
this email by the huge fund transfer opportunity that
will be of mutual benefit to the two of us.

However, I am Barrister Maxwell Obiekwu,the personal
attorney to the late Engr. Suk Hun Wufei, a Citizen of Japan, who used 
to work with
Nigerian National Petrolum Co-operatrion (NNPC). 
On the 26th of August 1999, my client,his wife and
their three
were involved in a fatal house explossion at
Nigerian National Petrolum Co-operatrion (NNPC)
quaters Lagos.
Unfortunately they all lost their lives including
other people in the premises.
Since then I have made several enquiries to several
Embassies to locate any of my clients extended
relatives, this has also proved successful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided 
to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any
member of his family but of no avail, hence I
contacted you. 

I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money 
and property left behind by my client since I have no
place to locate any of his relatives. I can easily
convince the bank with my legal
practice that you are the only surviving relation of
my client.
Otherwise the Estate he left behind will be
confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits
were lodged.
Particularly, My late client had an account with one
of the banks in Republic of Ghana valued at about
US$9.3Million (Nine Million Three Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) which I witness the
documentations and the documents are with me.

Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the
next of kin to my client or have the account
confiscated within the
next twenty-one official working days since I have
been 
unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over
several years now. 
I seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of
this account 
valued at US$9.3Million (Nine Million Three Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) will be paid into your
account and
then you and I can share the money. 55% to me and 40%
to you,while
5% should be for expenses,tax as your government or
Replic of Ghana may require. 

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used 
to back up any claim we may make. All I require is 
your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal 
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under 
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from 
any breach of the law. 
Please get in touch with me by return email or call me on 234 80371 
89723. 

Yours Faithfully, 

Barrister Maxwell Obiekwu . 

N.B. Please indicate your telephone and fax numbers 
for easy communication in this mutual transaction.

Compliments of the day to you!

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha widow of the late General Sanni Abacha
former Nigerian Military President who died on active Government
service on june 8, 1998.

I got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can
help me.

I am contacting you due to the present situation as regards the
undemocratic manner the present administration in my country
(Nigeria) is taking all that belongs to us You may be aware
that this is the usual attitude of leaders especially in Africa
when there is a change of Government. The present Government of
General Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my
family in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is
dead.

They have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.
Unfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National
Assembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The
law they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to
frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for
my family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was
jailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat
against his administration in 1995.


This highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some
Western Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from
us a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the
World. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to
the barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized
out of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This
assertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to
confirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from
their website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in the
March 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.

This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever
owe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed),
was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July
2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his
release and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been
languishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday
23RD September last year that he was finally released to us.

Please we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to help
us receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a
Security company which is our only hope / source of livelihood
for now. This is a call for you to help receive this money and
put the money into good investments since we are barred from
leaving the Country for now.

According to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we
still have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we
intend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to
handle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.

Please Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the
security company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall
give you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage
accrued over time payable to Security Company to enable
collection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the
time of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WAS
DEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLARED
TO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you can
do this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 as
you will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation and
agreement.

You can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister Ali
Koloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further
 details.

Endeavor to keep this highly confidential. In your response
include your private telephone / fax numbers for easy
communications with him.

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.

Attention Please,

I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section 
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. 
With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the 
transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.

The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand 
United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your 
impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole 
arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the 
deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign 
account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be 
relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to 
assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.

I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,

Yours faithfully,

Musa Garuba.

1,"Mrs.Rose Obaseki
Flat 8 Block 12 NNPC Quarters
Garki Abuja Nigeria.

Dear  Friend,

I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, but
as
things unfold, we will know each other better. I will start
by
introducing myself to you.

I am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson Gracious
Obaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,
Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that you
will be of a
good assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.
For many years of marriage now between me and my husband, I
have
not given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.
As a result 
of the respect given to local tradition culture and custom
here in 
Nigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. With
the situation of things
with me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am been
threatened daily
by my husband to get out from the home. My Husband s
brothers are not
left outin this matter. 


This situation has really affected me psychologically.
As at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,
hence I seek
your urgent assistance and help which I know will go a long
way in getting 
me settled finally.

I want to use this opportunity to move the sum of
(US$29.5M) into
your custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your
country. This
said amount was given to my husband as gratification from
some Foreign Oil
Companies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drilling
of Crude Oil
in Nigeria.

As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hence
he
gave me this money to keep in my personal account so that
he can be
exonerated from the eyes of government security operatives
and the 
Civil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body that
scrutinizes the activities of all
civil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for
official
misconduct. Be informed that this money is not connected
with drugs; money laundry,
firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in you
to render the 
required assistance needed from you and consequently
withdrawing your help for
security reasons.

Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.
This money was deposited in my personalin name, and
there is no way it can be transferred telegraphically under
the banking
procedures which could have been the easiest, but because
of monetary
transfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,
that is
defeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move
this money out in cash to any
destination where it will be easy for you to collect under
diplomatic
immunity.

This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your response
and
willingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish you
on the next line of
acti onto take, but be rest assured that this transaction
is 100% risk free,
and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will not
like to put
himself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, he
stands the
change of loosing his job.


As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm to
me
that you have received it, I will be coming to meet you up
there in 
your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. I
will be offering 
you 25% of this money for all your help at this time of
need, while some
percentages has been  set aside for my Brother to
complement his efforts here. Be
informed that this transaction will not last more than 14
working days
and it will be concluded because every arrangement has been
put in place.
Your negative or positive response will be highly
appreciated.

Yours faithfully,

Mrs. Rose Obaseki

Compliments Of The Day,

Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Dr Jerry Jerome, A Top 
management Official of one of the finance corporation in johannesburg 
south Africa.I came to know about you in my private search for a 
reliable person/company to handle an important assingment on behalf of 
my Colleagues and myself.As a matter of fact, I got your information 
from Miss Joyce Brown of The International Affairs  Department Of The 
South African Chamber Of Business.
 
Proposition A German Mr. peter 
khan, 66 years of age and a prosperous 
oil/Diamond merchant had in our 
Bank the sum of $35.5million in a domiciliary account.
 
Unfortunately, 
he was killed in 2002 plane crash involving concord AF4878 in Gonesse, 
France. Efforts has been made by the management of my bank through the 
German Embassy in johannesburg to contact any of the deceased children 
but to no avail,as we are made to understand he had no children.Given 
the skeletal information 
available to the bank, it has so far been 
impossible to reach any of the relatives.
The situation left for the 
Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the 
Amount to trading on behalf of the interest of the Bank.
 
In order to 
avoid this development, my Colleagues and I now seek your approval to 
have you stand as a distant relative to Mr. peter khan,so that the 
money would be released to you. All documents and proofs to enable you 
get the money will be carefully packaged once we receive your consent 
on this proposal.I  shall Apply for a leave as soon as the funds gets 
into your reliable account to come to your country for possible sharing 
and investment opportunity which you will assist me in doing.
May I 
assure you that  this is safe and risk-free, as we have taken care of 
all necessary modalities to ensure a hitch-free movement. I have the 
authority of my 
partners involved in this assignment to propose that 
should you be willing to assist us in this,your share would be 40%.
 
I 
have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint 
me.

Victoria Garden City
Marine Beach.

Date: 4th October, 2003.

Attention:

Dear Sir,

PRAISE GOD, THE MOST BENEVOLENT. 

I am Mrs. Victoria Bucknor,named person from Nigeria. I am married to Late Mr. George Bucknor of blessed memory who worked with Nigeria embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in the year 2000. 

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christain.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5Million (Five Million U.S. Dollars) in a security company. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. 

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church/organisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this church/organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
fund building church,orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
bible. 

The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I  don�t have any child that will inherit this money, and I don�t want my husband�s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don�t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful. I don�t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband�s relatives around me always. 

I don�t want them to know about this development. With GOD all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply, I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the christains/Muslims communities where you reside to always pray for me. 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church/organisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose. 

Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders. 

May the almighty GOD continue to guide and protect you. 

Regards, 

Mrs. Victoria Bucknor

Attention please,.... 


I humbly ask for your assistance to enable me transfer the money my late father kept in a bank in (THE TRUST BANK) before he died, into your nominated account overseas. 


My name is Bassey Attah, my mothers name is Madam Mariam Attah and my late fathers name is Chief Omeh Attah,he was a gold and diamond merchant from Ashanti region of Ghana in West Africa. 


I am from a polygamous family and my father has four wives and twenty-four children, am the eighth child and my mother is the last wife of my father and he entrusted all his valuable documents to her. 


Since we are from a polygamous home, after the death of my father, the whole family has been deserted. 


Now my elder brothers, sisters and their mothers are in search of my fathers documents but my mother who is in possession of the documents has refused to disclose the custodian of the documents to them, because they are all fighting for themselves and their selfish interest. 


Right now all I want from you is your bank account number where we can instruct the bank to transfer this money to you by telegraphic transfer, which takes about three working days. 


We are making this arrangement in order to avoid the rest of the children and their mothers, because if they find out they will take everything from us. 


The original document of the transaction including the pin code has been couriered to them by our family lawyer Barrister Henry mensah.


I am the next of kin to my fathers estates, as shown in the legal documents, please kindly help us to effect this transaction, it is for the mutual benefit of both parties, you will be entitle to twenty percent of the funds, as the owner of the account, the total amount in the bank is $28 million dollars. 


Please reply immediately with your Bank account details so that we can forward the information to the bank of ghana to expedite the transfer immediately.

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO 

Dear friend, 

l am Dr Mallam Galadima., the contracts verification manager of 
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Because of my position 
and that of other strategic officials who are heads in their 
Departments, we have in our possession, since 2001 the sum of US$400M 
Dolllars (Four hundred million United States Dollars) which we emassed 
through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully executed and 
commissioned with the different foreign contractors duely paid their 
full contract amounts.

We have made several fruitless moves to 
transfer this fund abroad for our mutual benefits. One in 2002 when one 
Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States of America, living at No 125 N. 
Kinsley Ave. Ocean City, NJ 082216, ran away with our US$65M Dollars 
after the fund has been transfered into his account. lt was 
unbelievable, shocking and hypertensive that when we went there to 
claim our share of the fund, we were told that nobody with that name 
was living in that house and that the former occupant of the flat moved 
away few weeks ago to an unkown house. This is how we lost US$65M 
Dollars to the heartless Mr. Lambert Brown. 

The second attempt was 
when in 2003, we decided to carry US$50M dollars in cash through the 
Lagos lnternational Airport but was stopped by the Nigerian Custom 
Officers who seized the fund till date . This is how we lost another 
US$50M Dollars to the Nigerian Custom. 

Following the peaceful life 
ushered in by the current democratic dispensation in Nigeria, l and my 
colleages have decided to transfer the sum of US$22M (Twenty Two 
Million dollars) into a foreign account operated by a foreigner for our 
mutual benefits. By this letter, l request your assistance in 
transferring and safeguarding the sum of US$22M Dollars for our mutual 
benefits. 

For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this 
fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum 5% will be set aside 
for charity and philantropic purposes 57% belongs to me and my 
colleagues while 3% will go for reimbursement of all expenses made by 
both parties. However, l want you to be human and humane so that you do 
not become this second Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States. lt is 
imperative to note that this transaction is risk free as all modalities 
for the successful transfer of this fund have been perfected by my 
colleagues in the relevant ministries. 

However, we should see 
absolute confidentiality as our watchword throughout the course of this 
transaction for we are civil servants and will equally not like the 
2002 event to redramatise itself. 

l will not be ungrateful if you can 
urgently furnish me with your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers 
and name of beneficiary with the telex numbers of the receiving bank. 
These will enable us speed up the claim of the fund and eventual 
transfer into your nominated account. Please reply via this alternative 
email address:mallamgaladima59@yahoo.com 

Looking forward to hear from 
you soonest. 

Dr.Mallam Galadima

Good Day,
I have a proposal for you-this however is not
mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to
honour against your will. I am Gideon Kwami,24 years
old and the only son of my late parents Mr and Mrs
Kwami.
I got your information in a Proffesional database when
I was searching through internet for a
reliable,honestand trustworthy person to entrust this
business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to
pick your contact from the many names in the list of
the directory after i, go into prayers/fasting.
Well, my father was the rebel leader of the liberian
crisis at ealer last two years before his sudden death
But God knows the truth. My mother died when I was
just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so
special.
Before his death on march 12/2003 he called his
friend who accompanied him to hospital and told him to
call me, on my arrival to the hospital my father told
me that he has the sum of twenty two million Dollars.
(22,000,000 USD) he deposited in his name,in a
security company in Ghana for safekeeping,
And told me where he kept the documents of his secret
funds deposited in Accra - Ghana,the most peaceful
nation in Africa.
And i'm with all the documents which my father used to
deposit the money,and he told me that he disguised the
content to the security as Family Valuable for
security Reason,and he told me that i shold not
disclosed to any body that he have money in the 
security company to avoid trace due to his position in
Liberia.
Please i want you to stand as my fathers partnership
to claim this money out from the security company. I
am just 24 years old and a University undergraduate
and really, I don't know what to do.I,contacted you
because I have suffered a lot of set back as a result
of incessant political crisis here in africa.
The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my
life, I am in a sincere desire of your humble
assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas
will be highly regarded.
It's my pleasure to bring to your notice that after my
late father was murdered the liberian government
siezed all my fathers belonging.
Moreso you should understand that due to the tension
that was impossed on me i am curently in Ghana under
the refugee camp to making sure that my life was safe.
Now permit me to ask these few question.
(1)Can you honestly help me as your son?
(2)Can I, completely trust you?
(3)what percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me.
With regards.
Gideon Kwami.

ABACHA COURT 
GIDADO ROAD 
KANO - NIGERIA 

ATTENTION:C.E.O 

I am lady Maryam Abacha, wife of the late General Sani 
Abacha,ex-military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who 
died on the 8th of June 1998 of heart problems.

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my 
family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. 

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death 
of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment 
and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the 
government and the press about my husband. 

The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are 
frozen and all assests siezed. 

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in 
the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my 
family fund in my possession and control. 

The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all 
our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the 
available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited 
with a security finance company in Holland.

My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the 
funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time 
when I will be free from my present predicament.


Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. 

Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for 
obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for 
easy and confidential communication. 

We await your immediate response. 

Sincerely yours, 

LADY MARYAM ABACHA

Dear Friend ,


Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met,permit me however, I am MR.HASSAN  GEORGE,a Zimbabwean Farmer. I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as reported by the International media.

I wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.

http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.

html This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison.

Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country.

I have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States Dollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know of the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the knowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk boxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then deposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic courier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic checks at the ports. 

The reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be transferred without any problems.
For now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the security company.

 Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and should
also be handled in the most confidential manner.

I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. 

If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for the investment in your country.

So based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my contact andexistence of my fund a secret.
 
I also require you to make available to me the following
 
1)Your Complete name.
 
2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with you easily.
 
 Sincerely Yours,

1,"Qin Wang
Lloyds TSB Pacific Limited
Hong Kong Branch Two Exchange
Square Central, Hong Kong.

Attention,

Thank you for giving me your time, it is of great importance for you to take
care and understand every word which I have written down below; please be
patient and read the explanation in my email.

I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc. here in Hong Kong attached in Private
Banking Services, I am contacting you concerning a customer and an investment
placed under our banks management; as a matter of factit was 3 years ago. I
would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and
also to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result
of this email. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is
informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts
that I believe would be of interest to you.

In 2001, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage
in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He
informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.37 million United States
Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the
officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties
as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services
epartment,especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however
I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The
favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600
traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative
investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities
and made attractive margins for our first months of operation,the accrued profit
with interest included, stood at this point at over 16.2 million United States
Dollars,this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low
risk guaranteed returns on investments.In mid 2002, he asked that the money be
liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash
payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited
with a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special
arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the
bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking
and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.

Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland
Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security
consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits
from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This
small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly
placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money
was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had,
this transpired aroundbFebruary 25th 2003. In June last year, we got a call
from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular
portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the
fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about
the deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his
deposit.

I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating
him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later,
information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who
suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of
France; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause of
death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into
possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come
forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs,
those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels
of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no
next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means
no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name;
depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also
gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the
bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said,
rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in
this case; he died Intestate.

In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we
instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have
right to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile.
We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate
companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that
resulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being
as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the estate
even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).My
official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the
investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.
What this means, with you being a foreigner, I have considered the fact that
our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This
leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing
situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the
deposit. According to practice, the firm shall by the end of this financial
year broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, failing to
receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to our
bank.This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system and
the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services
Department. This will not happen if I have my way.


What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want
you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world who
finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of
private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy
certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to
put together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$
15,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred
and seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do
so.

I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is
concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the
funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just
customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's
the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to
release the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the situation.
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the
deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family but
however the investigation has officially come to an end.

My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is
given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the
closest surviving relation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in
accordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the
common law,the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the
law, and this power has been extended to all a man's Personal and Real estate
(Personalty & Realty). There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from
being so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir's
acceptance; basically all persons of sound mind are competent to bequeath and
devise real and personal estate, excepting infants, with all this I would say
we have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation whereby
the paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole
beneficiary is confirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share
the money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share
the proceeds 50/50.

I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on
the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the
beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the
deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the
final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially
communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit
to you; with these two things: all is done.The alternative would be for us to
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this
way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.
We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the consequences
of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project that
you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or
destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget
I ever contacted you; please not destroy my career because you do not approve of
my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard
for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this
move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let
this chance pass me by and I hope you understand,because for once I found
myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't
pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with
me please let me know, and hence move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I
am a family man and this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities.
There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I
have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to
work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this
situation,good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of
relevance in my life, let?s share the blessing.

If you find yourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,
through this email account mrqinwang1954@netscap.net if you give me positive
signals, I will initiate this process towards a quick conclusion.It is
necessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via
official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our official lines neither do I
want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only
through this email address above; I do not want any direct link between you and
me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to
assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management
policy, please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a
family man; I happily married with kids, I send you this mail not without a
measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy
or on a platter of gold,this is the one truth I have learned from my private
banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I
shall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed we
can plan a meeting.

I await your response.

Yours Sincerely,

Qin Wang

            panmentat@phantomemail.com
            
KINDEST ATTENTION,

PLEASE PERMIT ME TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN SO INFORMAL A MANNER.
THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND
UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY
REQUEST VERY SERIOUS.

I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE
REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST)
I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR
COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT
AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS
WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN
INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD
LIGHT.

ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE
LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO 
CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF
ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE
SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE
ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF
THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH
BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE.

TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND
KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK
ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH
THE US$20.5M.


MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF
WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN,
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY,
THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN
ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I
DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE
ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED
WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS
ON IT UNTIL
IT GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY, WHERE I WILL COMMENCE INVESTMENT.

THE ONLY ASSISTANCE WE NEED FROM YOU WHICH I BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO FOR US ARE THE FOLLOWING:

1. MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENT TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF
THE CRATE (FUND) AT THEIR EUROPE OR AMERICAN
COMMISSION AGENTS.
2. ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON OUR
SHARE WHEN THIS FUND GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY.

MY WIFE AND I AGREED THAT YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO 20% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT WHILE THE PRINCIPAL SUM WILL BE INVESTED IN A VIABLE BUSINESS
VENTURE WITH YOUR ADVICE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LIKE TO BUY A
PERSONAL HOUSE WHERE MY WIFE, MY TWO SONS AND I WILL RESIDE.

UPON CONFIRMATION OF YOUR INTEREST TO HELP US AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER
TO CLAIM THE CRATE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY ON OUR BEHALF AT ANY OF
THEIR COMMISSION AGENT CLOSER TO YOU, I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH THE
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE CONSIGNMENT TO BE SCHEDULED IN YOUR
FAVOUR BY THE SECURITY COMPANY PREPARE AN AIRWAY BILL AND TAG THE
CONSIGNMENT IN YOUR FAVOUR.  YOUR PRIVATE FAX AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS
ARE NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE SPEEDY CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION (OUR
ONLY HOPE IN LIFE NOW) URGENTLY.
KINDLY TREAT AS URGENT AND CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY THROUGH THE ABOVE
E-MAIL ADDRESS {PANMENTAT@REDIFFMAIL.COM OR PANMENTAT@PHANTOMEMAIL.COM}.

ABIDJAN COTE D' IVOIRE 
WEST AFRICA.

Dearest, 

I am Mrs Comfort Somba from India. I am married to Late Mr Daniel Somba who worked with India embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. 

Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.5Million (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in one of the Security Company here in Abidjan. 

Recently, my Doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or individual that will utilize it the way I am going to instruct herein. 

I want a God fearing person that will use this fund for orphanage Homes, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that gives, I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and I don' t want my husband's efforts to be wasted or abandoned or a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. 

Due to my health conditions, I have forwarded all the necessary documents required for this fund released to the Security Company and also an Authority Letter Directing the Security Company to release this deposited family treasure to you as soon as you Identify yourself to the Security Company as the deposited family treasures recipient. 

Kindly contact the Security Company and request for this deposited family treasure as I have directed you.

Hoping to receive your reply Immediately. 
Yours in Christ, 
Mrs Comfort Somba.

1,"Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is MR.HARRY HAKEEM, a merchant in Dubai, in the
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few
months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called
me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family
members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS
$12,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security Company
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit
and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to collect this Funds and also invest this money.

N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE
LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE
DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY
UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR
SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME.

Dear Sir,

With due respect trust and humanity. I write you this letter which I believe, would be of great interest to you. I believe you are a highly respected personality considering a careful research which I have been able to make inrespect to your kind of person, before I decided to entrust this transactions and database in your country into your hands which I believe you will not betray my trust and confidence already entrusted on you.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins. My name is MRS. SUZANA NUHAN VAYE and my Son MUSA NUHAN VAYE, we are from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My late Husband MR. ISSAC NUHAN VAYE, was then Deputy Minister of Public Works during President Charles Taylor regim in Liberia. My Husband was falsely accused of plotting coup to remove the then President of Liberia (Charles Taylor) from office. Without trial, President Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web site below:

(i) http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm

Two days before his arrest, he managed to sneak out a written message informing me about one trunk box of valuable, containing money which he had concealed under the roof. He instructed me to take our only son and move out of Liberia immediately to Bangkok Thailand, I become a widow overnight, helpless situation without a partner. At that moment of calamity, every persons was running for his and her life. My son and I manage to escape through the help of an airline to Bangkok with the box and some vital documents property title. 

The cash involved in the box is Nine Million, Three Hundred Thousand United State Dollars (US$9.3M). Due to fear and limited rights as refugee, I deposited the box with a private security organization in order not to raise an eyebrow over the box here in Bangkok. My son's name is MUSA NUHAN VAYE and we are temporary residing in Uttaradit in the northern part of Thailand as assylum seekers. Be inform that the real content of the box was not disclosed to security company for security reasons. 

Concerning the money, we are prepare to give you a reasonable percentage of 30% of the total sum and 10% would be mapped out for any expences incured in the course of this transaction and 60% will be for my family. For the interest of this business do not hesitate to contact my son  MUSA NUHAN VAYE on this Tel: 66-5-1539304, or email:{suzananuhanvaye01@she.com} as soon as you receive this letter. Feel free to contact my son for more information. No other person know about this money apart from my son and I, endeavor to keep this business confidential.

We await your quick reponse. May God bless you.

1,"Dear Friend,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
met before.My name is Dr.Yacube Akim.I am the bill and exchange manager in
African Development Bank.I Hoped that you will not expose or betray
this trust and  confident that I am about to repose on you for the mutual
benefit of our both families.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished
along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the
whole passengers on  6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view
this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one
has come to claim his funds of US$8.3M (Eight Million Three Hundred
Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very 
long
time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the
Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again.The Banking ethics
here  does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the 
money
will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.

In view of this I got your contact through the internet when I was
making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great  opportunity
because i dont want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as 
uncliamed
fund.I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will 
be
for me.

The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the
deceased man was a foreigner and  it is not authorized by the law guiding 
our
Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the
request of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the release and
transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the surving
relation to the deceased.

If you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and
confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this 
business, reply
with your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you
wish to receive the fund.

Upon receipt of the above mentioned informations,indicating your
interest in the business,I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of 
application
which you will type  and send back to our bank to enable us start this
transaction.

I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch
free and dont have any negative impact.You should not entertain any fear as
all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has been
finalized, this  transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days
immediately we start the business.

Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are
not interested.

Regards,

    Dr.Yacube Akim

Ann Parker, a national of your country,. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On December 8, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Ann Parker. made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14.6,000,000.00(Fourteen Million, Six Hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally i discovered from her contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Ann Parker. died from a ghastly automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Ann Parker. did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork in her Bank. This sum of US$14.6,000,000.00 is still sitting in her Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Parker. so that the fruits of this woman's labuor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your 1.Your full names 2.Contact address3.Your direct telephone and Fax number4.Your age5.Your marital statusBased on the following informaion been provide by you i shall prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.

I would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs. Ann Parker. to travel and claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by her bank as an offshore payment center to the bank. The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you then 10% for any expensee that may come up.

May I take the liberty to introduce myself; I am Mr. Lin Geng. I am a
staff and a member Audit Committee of a reputable Bank in China. I am
contacting you concerning a customer here and, an investment placed under
our Care sometime ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the
contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of this
information. I contacted you independently of our investigation and nobody
else is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2000, the
subject matter came to our parent bank to engage in business discussions
with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a
financial portfolio in United States Dollars, which he wished to have us
turn over (invest) on his behalf. We spun the money around various
opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of
operation, the accrued profit was very impressive. He later directed that
I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a security firm.

In October last year, we were contacted by the security firm informing us
of the Issues concerning that particular portfolio. This was a surprise
given the fact that I personally managed the said funds yet I cannot
understand the inactivity of the deposit. We made several unsuccessful
efforts to locate him. The Internal Investigations department of the bank
of china was invited and they went into action and later informed that a
person who suited is description was found dead in Cannes South of France.
His body was later identified and cause of death was confirmed. An
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the
situation and also to come forward to claim his estate was launched.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually
in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.

In line with banking policies for account holders who have passed away, we
instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should
have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months
been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. My
official capacity dictates that I supervise the investigation and conclude
making me the only person with a full picture of what the prevailing
situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the
deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial
quarter broadcast a request for statements of claim to BOC, failing to
receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to
BOC. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I
want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking
world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.
The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for
those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You
should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I
propose. This deposit is very huge with the details in my possession and
will only be released on my clarification. This bank has spent great
amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated
for months and have found no family

My proposal; is to place you in the position of the next of kin and have
the deposit released to you. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to
share the money with you favorably. That is: I will simply nominate you as
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the
proceeds 60/30. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you
within a few working days. I will simply inform the bank of the final
closing of the file relating to the customer I will then officially
communicate with firm clarifying and confirming you with proper
documentations and thereafter have the funds released to you. The
alternative would be for us to have firm direct the funds to another bank
with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to
think of receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this based on
our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask
that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this
mail and not be vindictive and destructive. There is a reward for this
project and it is a task worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and
the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and
alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, let's
share the blessing.

If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me. If you give me your
trust and confidence, we shall rejoice and our lives will never be the
same again. Please do not contact me via official channels. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I
have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of
fear as to the consequences, yet I know within me that nothing ventured is
nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter
of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking
clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we
should plan a meeting soon.

I await your response.

Thanks
Lin Geng

1,"Dear friend, 

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu 
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this 
letter. This was in confidence considering my present 
circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my 
husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote 
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later 
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later 
died of cancer disease. 

However, due to this situation we decided to change 
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in 
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of 
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of 
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement 
with the Swiss government and other European countries 
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in 
some european countries. Hence, my children and I 
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation 
till when things gets better. Like now that 
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over 
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in 
Southern France was confiscated by the french 
government, and as such I had to change my identity so 
that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. 
I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State 
Dollars (US$14,000,000,00.) With a security company 
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate 
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the 
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my 
son (Joseph) who has the out modalities for the claim 
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing 
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. 
I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and 
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in 
other safe and non-speculative investments as advise 
by your good self. 

May I at this point emphasize the high level of 
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands, 
and hope you will not betray the trust and 
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if 
you want to assist us, my son (Joseph) shall divulge 
to you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where 
the funds are currently being maintained and also 
discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason 
kindly furnish us your contact information,that is 
your personal telephone and fax number for validation 
purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the 
above email address. 

Yours sincerely, 

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

URGENT ATTENTION

I am Dr. Mogogo Mogul, Chairman of Contract Award and Verification Panel set up by the Nigeria Ministry of Aviation. I got your contact from the net during my personal search ,after thorough deliberations,my colleagues and I decided to contact you for a very confidential business transaction of mutual benefit.

During our verification exercise, we came across an over-invoiced contract(Contract No: FMA/PED/1473/96). This contract was awarded in July,1996 and completed in August, 1998, and the original contractor has since been paid his contract sum leaving the over-invoiced sum of US$25.5m(Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) This amount have been left floating in our account with the federation bank, until our recent discovery.

My coleagues and I have decided to seek for the assistance of a reliable foreign partner into whose account the fund will be transferred into for our own use. If this proposal is acceptable to you, a “Deed of Transfer” of the above contract will be obtained on your behalf, to empower you as the legal beneficiary of the contract and the sum to be transferred. All necessary and relevant documents will be procured for the release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.
An application for foreign exchange allocation will be made on your behalf from my office to the federal ministry of finance (FMF) and the federation bank for the subsequent release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.Be informed that we are working in collaboration with top officials of the federal ministry of finance and the federation bank, who will assist us in the transfer of the fund. With your cooperation the success of this transaction is guaranteed.

We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum, 70% will be for me and my colleagues here, while the remaining 5% have been mapped-out for miscellaneous expenses that might be incurred by both parties during the course of this transaction. All things being equal, this transaction will be concluded within 6 working days upon the day of receipt of your response. You are required to email us your nominated bank account details and your direct telephone and fax numbers. Please treat this transaction with top priority and remember to keep it as confidential as possible.

As soon as we receive your response, more details about how to proceed will be given to you. Best Regards,

DR. Mogogo Mogul Chairman,

Contract Award & Verification Panel

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. 

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of
my colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in the
internet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential 
co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of
all 
parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of
this business.
Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work
as a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation
of four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage
of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance 
unclaimed. 

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.
As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation
of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as
the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed
to operate a foreign account. 

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,
should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share
as compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and
the balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that
your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other
companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms
of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my
 e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this
deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that
you treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form
of exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active
Government Service. 

Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in
you and hope that you will not disappoint us. 

Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance
of this proposal. 

Regards, 

Engr.Makalele Johnson

11/F Hang Seng Wanchai Building,
200 Hennessy Road, Wanchai


Hello,
 
I am Mr Vincent Cheung, of the Hang Seng Bank 
11/F Hang Seng Wanchai Building, 200 Hennessy Road, Wanchai .
An Iragi named Fadi Basem,a business man made a numbered fixed deposit 
of (346,736,899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months, this is valued to 
Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in 
my 
branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the 
war, four years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification 
was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that 
Fadi Basem and his family had been killed during the war in Gunfire 
that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.
 
After further investigation it was also discovered that Fadi Basem
did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the 
paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last 
time 
he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my 
bank. So, Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State 
Dollars is 
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 
What bothers me is that according to the laws of my country at the 
expiration five years six months the funds will revert to the ownership
 
of 
the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 
My proposal, We are prepared to place you as the next of kin in a 
position to instruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as 
the 
closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, we am prepared
 
to 
share the money with you on to be agreed on percentages. That is: I
 will simply nominate you 
as 
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. I would have
 gone ahead to ask the funds be released
 to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in 
claiming the deposit.I assure you that I could have the deposit 
released 
to you within the coming weeks. I will simply inform the bank of the
 final 
closing of the file relating to the late customer, I will then 
officially 
communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the deposit to 
you. 
With these: all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this 
proposal.
 
I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should 
discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive.
 
If 
my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message and forget I ever 
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of 
my 
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made 
tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking 
sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good 
conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of
 
my 
industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come 
ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for 
once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont 
pass 
me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work 
with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy 
me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with 
new 
opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well
 
worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have 
here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am 
the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you 
with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my 
life. 
Lets
share the blessing.
 
If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a
 
conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via 
official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I 
repeat, I 
do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I 
want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me 
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through the 
email account that i will provide therein in this email.
 
Further more be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives 
you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my 
deceased client had no relation all his family died with him during the
 
war and I can not use my relations because its not accepted here in 
Hong Kong. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish 
the 
trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need from the
 
time been is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in
 
the next two weeks.
 
What you need to understand about this transaction is that I will make 
sure that it passes through all international banking laws regards to 
this I will give the transaction the proper documentation 
that is required to perfect the finishing. Your only obligation in this
 
transaction will be to set up the offshore accounts that can 
accommodate these funds and I will give you more light later once you 
agree to 
partner with me.
 
Like I said before there is no risk involve as it will pass through 
international banking laws and all documents related to this 
transaction 
will be sent to you by post for your perusal and trust.
 
I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are
 
not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level
 
of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. 
Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a
 
family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not 
without a 
measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that 
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never 
come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned
 
from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can
 
be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon. Should you be 
interested I will prefer you to reach me via email.

1,"My Dear Friend,

My name is Mr.Musa A. Zulu, the manager, credit
and foreign bills in African Development Bank Plc.
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of
my bank with account number 89-3k7-1996/adb who
perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801]
with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.

Since the demise of this our customer, whom I could not care lessa
bout,
I personally
have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin
but all has proved abortive as no one has come to
claim his funds of us$.57 m, [Fifty seven million
united states dollars] which has been with my branch
for a very long time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name
could be used as the next of kin as no one has come up
to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here
does not allow such money to stay more than seven
years, because the money will be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of
this I got your contact through my search via business
report from your web site to see if you can assist. I
will give you 25% of the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you
by fax or e-mail the application letter, bank's fax
number and the next step to take. I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this business is hitch free
and that you should not entertain any fear as all
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within
five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a
relation to the deceased.
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail
signifying Your decision including your private
Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.

Yours faithfully,

MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS)
RE: 
TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR
ACCOUNT.
My name is Mr.
Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in 
a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this 
important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly 
abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the 
fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is 
unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. 

At first I 
will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble 
free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE 
IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS 
ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime
Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United 
Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of
(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS 
STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family 
valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine 
inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. 
Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS 
STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that 
the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the 
account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the 
former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that 
nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can 
only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, 

Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide 
all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in 
God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa 
Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek 
Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, 
and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) 
before his last resignation from office on October 20,
2004. The late 
Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to 
around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the 
Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information 
please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS 
MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER 
WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A 
SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL 
AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET 
ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Best Regards 

Mr.Jason

dglobalfax@yahoo.com



I am Edwin Useni, a director in the project and planning department of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), I head a seven man Tenders Board Committee in charge of contract award and Payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  


There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (NNPC) among which were;  

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation - US$2 Billion.  


2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Refineries in the country.  


3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots)-US$94 Million.  


The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$25,500,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount into your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names. 


Needless to say, the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 15% of the transferred sum, 5% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.  

You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.  


Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 0f Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above terms.  


Our assurance is that your role shall be totally risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of funds, the whole procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.  


Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years in the Civil Service of my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the second batch of the 2001 fiscal year contract payments.  


BEST REGARDS.

I am Mr. Smith E. Kimwal, I live at number 38 High road, ttf. 228 
England. I am the only child of my father My Father was a wealthy 
Coffee Merchant before he was poisoned to death by his business 
associate on one of their out going discussion on a business trip, due 
to jealous and Greed.

Before his death, he told me that he deposited a box that contains his 
personal documents and the sum of four Million Pounds Sterling with a 
security finance company in London for safekeeping. He gave me the 
document, which he made with my name as the next of kin. He told me to 
relocate to US, and reside there permanently that in no condition I 
will decide to reside here for the sake of my life. 

I am soliciting for your assistance in claiming and receiving this box 
that contains the fund on my behalf. I would be coming over to reside 
permanently, invest with the money and start a good living without 
fear. I need your assistance to get back to good living because I have 
nothing left, the fund in question is the only hope I have. If you 
decide to help me out of this predicament, when I arrive US, I will 
compensate you with twenty percent out of the total fund.

Union Bank Plc.
Lagos � Nigeria. 

I am the manager of bill and exchange Foreign
Operations Department of Union Bank of Nigeria. I am
writing following an impressive information about you
through one of my friend who runs a consultancy firm.
He assured of your capability and reliability,
although I did not tell him the details of the
business I want to do with you. 

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 
$11.5million dollars (Eleven million five hundred
thousand United States Dollars) in an account that
belongs to one of our foreign customers who died
along side his entire family on 2002 E.A.S plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have
been expecting his relation to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately we learnt that all his immediate family
members died along with him at the plane
crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund
behind for the claim since the account is his private
account. It is therefore upon this discovery that I
and two other officials in this department now decided
to make business with you and release the money to
you as the next of kin to the deceased for safety
keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and we don�t want this money to go back
into Federal
Government account as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that
such money remained after Seven years the money will
be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed
funds and will further be handed over to government.
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer
was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of
kin to a foreigner.

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, while the balance will be for my
colleagues and I. I will visit your country for the
disbursement according to the percentages indicated
above once this money gets into your account. Please
be honest to me. 

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the
funds to you as arranged, you must apply first to my
bank as next of kin of the deceased. Upon receipt of
your response I will send to you a text of the
application with the name of the deceased and his
country and other information about him.

Note this transaction is confidential and 
risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you
should contact me through my e-mail address or
alternative email address ahmedmartins10@juno.com 
Best regards

AHMED MARTINS. D

I am JOHN ISHMEAL ,20years old and the son of  late Mr.and Mrs THODER ishmeal.My father was a highly reputable busnness man-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 13th  feb. 2002.Although his  death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
My mother died when I was just 3 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death
he called the secretary who accompanied him to the
hospital and told him that he has the sum of Nine million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.700,000) left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks.
 
In his farms here he still has worth of (USD$700,000) Seven hundred thousand United State  dollars cocoa which will be ready for exportation in 6 weeks time.
 
He further told him that he had changed the name used  in depositing the money in my name,and finally
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary and legal documents to this fund and the bank.
 
I am just 20 years old, and really don't know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this fund and to continue my education because of the risk of insecurity to my live.My uncle has been after me,ever since he understand that My Father willed all his assest to me.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.
Therefore I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.

3.What percentage of the total amount in question  will be good for you after the money is in youraccount?
4.Can you help me in investing in a proper  and profitable way and not regreting associating with you.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS:   williamsd3@rediffmail.com

Dear Friend,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR Williams Daniel of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.
 
Best Regards

now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since 
you share the same last name with him.

This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from 
his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are 
interested in working with me,

please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details 
of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give 
you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Best regards,

Melvin.

You may be surprised to receive my letter, however, I got your contact As a 
result of my desperate desire for assistance, and though this mail is 
Unsolicited I pray you be humane to consider it. I have decided to contact 
you for confidential, urgent and rewarding joint business.

My name is Dr.Paul Osadebe; I am from the Federal Republic of Nigeria and 
the chairman, Contract Award Committee of Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC). I have been on this position for the past ten years; but 
I have nothing to show for it. I will love it, if the both of us could do 
business together, which will be of mutual benefit.

Since I am the Chairman Contract Award Committee, I will award a Forty 
million US dollars ($40 million USD) contract in your favour to supply Gas 
Turbines and equipments. A Mobilization (up front) fee of twenty million U.S 
Dollars ($20 million USD) will be given to you to start the supply. But as 
soon as the mobilization fees gets to your hands, you are not going to do 
the supply. You and myself will share this mobilization fee on a 50-50 basis 
(Equally). The reason why I want us to share this start up fee is because I 
have been in this Position as the chairman for the past ten years, and I 
dont have a personal house of my own, my salary is a peanut. I cannot 
adequately take care of my children. In fact, things are very difficult for 
me. If I retire, I will have nothing to fall back on. People come sometimes 
to seek for favour from me and after awarding them contracts; theyll not

A lot of people promised and failed me. As a result of this, I want to help

successfully complete it within five days. I am the person who will 
authorize the release the start up fee to you.

You have nothing to fear. I want you to remove anything like fear from your 
mind. This is the safest business you can ever think of. I will give you 
more information on how we are going to do this business as soon as I

Pretoria, South Africa.

 Sir,

 On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this
 letter with great pleasure. Your information were
 given to me by a member of the South African Export
 Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)
 delegation on a trip to the United States during a
 bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
 investors. I have decided to seek a confidential
 co-operation with you in execution of a business
 transaction hereunder for the benefit of all
 parties.

 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I
 work as the Director of Project Implementation, with
 co-operation of two other top officials, we have in
 our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.

 The said funds represent certain percentage of the
 contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by
 a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
 over-invoiced to the amount of US$14,300,000.00
 (Fourteen  Million, Three Hundred Thousand United
 States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has
 been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
 excess balance unclaimed.

 The Government of the Republic of South Africa
 believe that private investment in general, and
 foreign direct investment in particular, are the
 real engines for sustainable economic development,
 for which reason it has continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of
 Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign
 contractors all debts owed to them, so as to
 continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually
 beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and
 non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we
 included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of
 Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
 We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary
 of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to
 operate a foreign account. The changing of
 beneficiary's information/details and other forms of
 documentation upon application for claim to reflect
 the contract money and its approvals will be secured 
 on behalf of your company or your good self.
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
 propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
 this transaction your share as compensation will be
 30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%, and
 the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
 expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
 incurred.

 It does not matter whether or not your company does
 contract projects of the nature described here. The
 assumption is that your company won the major
 contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
 More often than not, big trading companies and firms
 of unrelated fields win major contracts, and
 subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.

 This business itself is 100% safe, provided you
 treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your
 pecialization is not a hindrance to the successful
 execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I
 have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
 will not disappoint us.

 Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon
 your acceptance of this proposal.

 Regards,

 Engr. Zulu Makaleni.

I am writing you this mail today on personal grounds
and l implore you to get back to me in earnest. I am
interested in doing business with your humble self,
but before I proceed further, I want you to please
note that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.

I want to invest heavily in your country and other
countries within your geographical zone as you may
indicate as ideal. Once you are interested in this
proposed joint venture transaction, I will be giving
you a breakdown; we will start relating with each.

As you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C
(Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary
of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C.
My office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign
companies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as
well as registering and certifying each and every one
of them before a single barrel is lifted. 

As a result of the recent upsurge in the price of
crude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on
a barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had
realized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil
servants getting this money out of my country
(Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following
the fact that Government officials are prohibited from
running a foreign account, and as such, I crave your
indulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to
assist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to
business. Please Email me your response to my personal box:

(drgodianokocha@myway.com) 

As the transaction progress, you stand the chance to
negotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M
(FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).

I further assure you that this is a risk-free
business, Thank you for anticipated cooperation. 

I shall be expecting your response.

I remain
Yours truly
Dr Godian Okocha

Dear Friend,

Please do not be disturbed about this mail as I am
contacting you for the first time through this medium, 
while nursing no doubts that you will be of great 
assistance to this business proposal  I am about 
disclosing to you for our both mutual benefit.


I am Dr. Ken Dikko, the Project Director of
Nitel at the above address.

Following my intentions of owning an offshore
investment, I was urged to  contact a foreigner 
to assist in facilitating the  immediate release 
of $14Million United States Dollars into his/her bank
account to jointly execute my motive of securing 
an offshore  investment. This was because Nigeria's 
civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil 
servant to own an offshore account or investment
outside the shores of Nigeria.

Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr.
Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist 
with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded 
in procuring all documents necessary to  facilitate the 
immediate release of the funds into his custody using
him as a Project Consultant to the Nigerian 
Telecommunication.

The money was as a result of an over-invoiced contract
on contract  number ""ntl-fgn01/ped-98"" for the 
procurement, supply  and installation of 
Telecommunication equipment to Nitel regional offices
up to the tune of $52Million United States Dollars. 
It was awarded to a  Swiss Contractor who executed 
the contract and was fully paid i.e $38Million United 
States Dollars leaving aside $14Million United States
Dollars.

Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr.
Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) 
to the paying bank while waiting for the payment 
application from him to the bank but he
suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no 
Next of kin/beneficiary to the funds.

It is as a result of this, that I am contacting 
you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr. 
Jim Walsh and new beneficiary  to the funds to 
enable the funds to be transfered into your custody.
All documents to back up your claim will be giving 
to you adequately  while a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) will be reached between us to safe
guard our both interest in line of this transaction.

I am willing to compensate you with 25% of the total
funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the 
investments in your country as well as assuring 
you that this transaction is 100% risk free
and legal.

If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get
back to me to enable  me demand certain informations 
and briefing for the commencement of this transaction.

Please always quote the reference number above in all
correspondences to me while confidentiality should be 
our watch word.

I await your urgent response.

Sincere regards,

Dr. Ken Dikko.

Project Director,
Nitel.
